4534	A ball he fell as Tchatzki did.
 156	A ball here, there a children's treat,
3001	A ball in Peter's capital,
3718	Abandon cities riotous,
4525	Abandoned he his country seat,
1555	"Abandon hope for ever here!"
 492	Abandoning insane delight,
4990	A bastard fame prohibited?
4052	A bearded postillion astride
1324	A beau is for Tattiana found!
2279	A beauty languidly at rest,
4080	A bill of fare hangs full in sight
2388	A blessed bottle, placed in ice,
4528	A blood-bespattered shade would rise,
 562	A boat with splashing oar floats by,
3951	A bogy conjured up in joke,
3869	A book at early morn perused.
2313	A bottle of a vintage white
 871	About the crop of hay, the wine,
1274	About the rain and flax and cattle."--
1210	Above the ashes of the dead.
3747	Above the humble urn of death.
3275	Above the yawning grave would fight,--
3369	A box of terrible import.
4954	A breathless silence then, prolonged--
2639	A bristly bear of monstrous size!
 553	Absorbed in melancholy mood
 258	Abuse their masters, rub their hands:
2693	A canine face with horns thereon,
 218	A careless looker-on estranged
 504	A case of books he doth obtain--
2647	Accelerates her hasty pace,
1449	Accents of rapture or despair
4845	A certain little escapade
 534	A charm with it in conversation.
1058	A child devoid of childishness
1950	A constant harping on one tune,
3843	A countenance perplexed and scared.
2215	A country damsel's album trim,
 895	Acquaintance instantly to make.
2699	A crab upon a spider rides,
 184	A critic of the stage malicious,
2160	Across her youth a shade had come,
 267	Across the Baltic's salt sea waves,
2552	Across the gloom of heaven would sail
2162	Across the smiling face of dawn.Alas! Tattiana fades away,
 248	Across the stage still madly sweep,
1804	A cup of tea upon a tray.
 968	A curious interest disclose
3941	A dagger, asterisk, or note
3947	A dangerous, gloomy misanthrope,
1721	Address to you one single phrase
3794	A deadly pallor, air distressed;
4058	"Adieu! thou home where peace abides,
4129	Adieu, thou witness of our glory,
5050	Adieu! whate'er thou didst desire
2312	A dinner, whimsical each course,
3166	Admired his judgment, which was fine,
1256	Admirer of the peaceful Muse,
4929	A door he opens. But why shrank
 273	Adorned the apartment of Eugene,
1063	Adorned with many a vision bright
 696	A double force unto their song
2208	A dove which on a lyre doth sit;
2620	A dreadful sleep Tattiana sleeps.
2673	Adroitly seized and carried her;
3383	A duellist of classic mind,
 621	A due which must to earth be paid.The courtyard full of serfs he sees,
2697	A dwarf adorned with tail, again
  10	A dying man with art to soothe,
4546	A faithful model she appeared
3804	Afar is borne by cruel fate,
 734	Afar, where clothed in green and gold
1704	A feeble version read below,
 917	A few of different temper deemed,
2230	_Affectionately yours till death_.
4966	Affection how did you requite?
 807	A fiery and eccentric mind,
2311	A fiery, yet well-broken horse,
1397	A finished madrigal would frame
4372	A first success light pinions gave,
2213	A flimsy trace of musings past
1736	A fond and careful mother been.
 295	A fop, in dress pedantical.
2651	A forest now she sees in front
2629	A fragile bridge and insecure,
2558	A friar black approaching near,
3549	A friendly hand thy life hath ta'en!
3799	After the wedded couple strain;
2976	Again a century should scourge
4321	Again her rural life she sought,
 411	Again imagination blazed,
 213	Again in her ethereal dance?
2172	Against my inclination, friends,
3024	Again the giddy waltz repeats.
4640	Again the plague of boyhood--love?The hours once more Oneguine counts,
3116	A gambling troop when he controlled,
2198	A game of chess would often play,
3835	A garden by a shining rill.
5000	Age immature averse to cheat--
2784	A grammar, likewise Petriads two,
2127	Agreed! but then the whirl of fashion,
 406	A gust of passion never tore
3102	A hand of ice appeared to seize
2022	A happy destiny ordained:
4105	Ah! brethren, what was my delight
4163	"Ah! come, Tattiana, come to me!
1408	A heart wherein pure passion burnt;
2354	A heavy goose on scarlet feet,
1095	A hemisphere beneath her sway,
2298	A hermit's life Oneguine led,
4339	Ah! he has gone the other way"--
2542	A hidden meaning could impart,
 387	A hidden train of wild desire.
4177	Ah! I'm so weak--my throbbing breast!
 364	Ah! I still struggle to forget
3276	Ah! it may be, affection true
4586	"Ah! long the world hath missed thy shape!
1866	A horse's hoofs she hears--She shrinks!
1868	Ah! than a spectre from the dead
2107	A hundred times will not repeat,
5082	Ah! what hath fate not torn away!
 564	A jolly song and distant horn;
3657	A journey to Moscow! To see the world!
2352	A joyous troop of little boys
4150	A Kalmuck gray, in caftan rent
1529	A kerchief round her silver hair
1164	Akulka who was once Celine,
 103	A labour, torment, yet a joy,
4537	A lady draws the hostess near,
 794	A lady's hand doth never kiss.
3765	A lancer captivates her heart!
3766	A lancer her soul dotes upon:
3101	Alarmed by jealous agonies:
4034	Alarm the winter journey gave.The date was fixed though oft postponed,
4173	Alas! abroad I cannot go.
1508	"Alas! dear nurse, my heart is cleft,
1347	Alas! for now before her passed
1489	Alas! how wretched now my lot!"
2150	Alas! It is not hard to guess.
3979	"Alas! my friend, no revenue!"
1387	Alas! my friends, the years flit by
4836	Alas! she is as hard, behold,
3800	Alas! the friend of childish days
3547	Alas! the youthful lover slain,
1781	Alas! with merited reproach.
2242	Albums magnificent which scare
4053	A lean and shaggy nag doth ride,
4884	A lethargy of sense, a trance,
1384	A letter for her hero meant:
3534	A life in common with the rest;
3541	A life of fact, not fiction, led--
1563	Alike by sighs and flattery.
4157	"Aline!"
2984	A little farther please to read
  74	A little Juvenal to spout,
2618	A little virgin mirror peeps.
1029	All about Olga--to a light
3025	All are amazed; but Lenski he
 508	All are constrained and fetters bear,
2724	All arise. To the door he goes.Terror assails her. Hastily
2076	All breathless and without replies.
2622	All covered up with snow in heaps,
3464	All dark and silent hath become;
2411	All hail! my good old friend Bordeaux!The fire sinks low. An ashy cloak
4210	All in the good old style appears,
 881	All mothers their sweet girls believed
2482	All Nature winter seemed to await,
 790	All overtures of friendship ended.
3028	All rattled in the ball-room vast,
3247	All silently hung down his head.
3081	All slumber. In the drawing-room
2493	All so distinct, and all so white!
2948	All sons of mental weariness.Eight rubbers were already played,
5065	All that a poet could desire,
 265	All that industrial London brings
1403	All that perfection could desire;
4822	All that the heart would fain express--
1363	All the creations which below
1084	All the young people round about,
 749	All this I know is out of date,
 533	All this in many cases brings
1767	All this may be an empty dream,
3269	All this, my friends, translate aright:
 922	All this was novel to Eugene.
4757	All to the doctors Eugene send,
2999	All to the grand saloon are gone--
1897	Allure the young gallant
2159	All vanished as an echo goes.
 783	All visited him at first, of course;
 268	All which caprice and affluence craves,
 269	All which in Paris eager taste,
3644	All with urbanity betray,
4898	Almost became a poet say--
3428	A loaded pistol in his hand."Advance!"--
2803	A load of care upon the maid."But lo! forth from the valleys dun
 769	Alone amid possessions great,
2367	Alone beneath your rooftree stay
3755	Alone beside it, gray and bent,
 793	Alone he doth his claret drink,
3566	Alone she gallops on her steed,
4931	Alone the princess sitteth there,
2377	Alone within his habitation
 577	Alone with my Venetian maid,
 490	Along Saint Petersburg's paved streets,
4554	Along the hall, and high above
4918	Along the Neva's bank he sleighs,
4766	A love epistle he doth scrawl.
1593	A lover's letter might convey,
1614	A love which knew no limitation,
2324	Already Autumn chilled the sky,
3254	Already by repentance moved
3826	Already dance to song proceeds;
4756	Already he grew phthisical.
3674	Already sings the nightingale.
4783	Also my wretched liberty
4269	Also one Viazemski, remarking
 361	Also their feet--yet ne'ertheless
4861	Also the works of Fontenelle,
2966	Also thy rough-and-tumble fights,
2782	Also, to equalise the scales,
2767	Although her book did not contain
4563	Although it will not bear translation,
2574	Although the destined coffin nears,
3393	Although unknown to fame mayhap,
  87	Although we read him heaps of verse.
2179	Always together, eventide
4235	A maiden's secrets--of the heart.Triumphs--their own or those of friends--
2065	A maid hath oft, may yet again
4895	A mansion--by the window, see!
2996	A marriageable maid matured,
4435	Amazed at the confusing crowd,
 275	Amber on pipes from Stamboul glows,
  67	Amid a serious disputation,
3641	Amid coquettes who pray to God
 444	Amidst successes flattering
1560	Amid submissive herds of men
3647	Amid the awful emptiness
3020	Amid the company career.
2624	Amid the snowdrifts which surround
3636	Amid the soulless sons of pride
4600	A mien unaltered she preserved,
  73	A mild quotation to translate,
 910	A million bipeds reckons thus
1824	Am I to go through the whole list?""How dull you are this morning, nurse!"
3133	A modern Regulus unchained,
1230	A moment effervescing stirs,
2838	Among some ancient ballads thrust,
1012	A mournful temper on his Muse.
4214	Amy Petrovna  utters lies,
3126	An ace at fifteen paces bored.
2203	An album, fly-leaf of the tome,
 766	An almanac but eight years old.
1300	An ancient lady full of grace.--
1584	An ardent heart and yet so mild?--
3642	And abject slaves who kiss the rod;
3339	And about dawn upon his breast
1857	And a boy handed round the cream.
1583	And a determined disposition,
 572	And after Albion's proud lyre
1388	And after them at headlong pace
2605	And "Agathon" replied, amazed.
1240	And agitate my heart again;
2806	And a grand festival proceeds.
 889	And a guitar produced we see,
2781	And a half rubles down gave she;
4529	And aimless journeys did commence--
2659	And all in snow is buried deep.The wood she enters--bear behind,--
3618	And all that from thy hand proceeds--
2515	And all the joys which Winter knows.
3152	And all the three to breakfast went;
2265	And all thy precious elegies,
 781	And all with one accord agreed,
1152	And all without her husband's leave.
2147	And all your love on self bestow;
3960	And a long time about her talked.
2795	And alphabetically tries
 328	And also fashionable beaux.Our hero stops and doth alight,
 309	And also that my feeble verse--
2251	And a malicious epigram
3388	And ancient usages observed
1220	And an elegiac poem wrote.
1790	And an enchanting shoulder shines
4381	And an encouragement did breathe
1196	And a new diadem supplied.
 989	And an habitual sense of pain;
4272	And an old gent the poet marking
1433	And a romance in ancient style
4424	And as a country damsel roved,
  90	And at economy was great;
 845	And at the altar of their fame
4076	And at the stages bugs and fleas
2882	And at the table sat her down.To tragedy, the fainting fit,
2413	And barely visible the smoke
2032	And be as happy--as I might.
 233	And beats with rapid foot the floor.
 584	And beckon to the passing sails.
2597	And bends her mirror on the moon,
2985	And be not in advance severe.
4964	And better, if I judge aright;
1503	And bitter tears of fright I shed.
1731	And bitter torment never known.
 838	And bless mankind with full delight.
4374	And blest me, sinking to the grave.
3322	And blest the shadows of the night."To-morrow's dawn will glimmer gray,
3473	And blush to own himself reflect.
4379	And boiling o'er with friendly heat,
 522	And both of dull existence tired,
2288	And breathe a drama in his ear.
1859	And breathes upon the chilly glass,
 548	And breathe the balmy breath of night;
4849	And brooding o'er the ills he bore,
2378	And buried deep in meditation,
1218	And by a genuine sorrow stirred,
4378	And by a partial temper stirred
 819	And by a sweet delusion he
3558	And by that shady rivulet
 340	And by the fiddle's rushing sound
3750	And, by the light the moonbeams gave,
2956	And, by the way, I here assert
2102	And by the world repeated oft,
1098	And calmly sleeps the hours away,
3057	And can it be? But late a child
 971	And cannot anything conceal,
1237	And care but little for its ends.
1469	And cares not farther to proceed;
2856	And chattering loud sit down to dine.Ceased for a space all chattering.
4073	And Christian folk will, I expect,
2300	And clad in airy costume took
 173	And Comet champagne foaming flows.
2845	And comfort of each country dame,
1142	And consolation soon begot.
3627	And contemplative dreaminess;
 519	And cool sagacious mind he had:
1393	And courtier, fop, and usurer
1752	And cried within myself: 'tis he!
1519	And crossed with trembling hand the maid."I am in love," her whispers tell
1254	And cry: he was a poet great!
3708	And dames of fine organisations,
1080	And dark and drear the evenings were,
1194	And death before the husband wide
 929	And deem the world perfection is!
4732	And devastate the woods around.There was no doubt! Eugene, alas!
2553	And disappear in space; then she
 990	And distance interposed in vain,
4421	And ditties of the steppe she loved.
4591	And dost thou know her?"--"We live near."
 220	And dream of life's delightful dawn?The house is crammed. A thousand lamps
 348	And due precautions take betimes.
 272	And ease and fashionable waste,--
 698	And ease the tortures of the heart--
1045	And education runs to waste,
3073	And endless the cotillon seemed
3461	And enmity and hope and love--
1542	And Eugene ever in her soul
 980	And Eugene soon discovered there
 654	And every morning I awake
2534	And every year distributed
4202	And exclamations and good cheer.
4156	And exclamations interlaced."Princesse, mon ange!"--"Pachette!"--
 921	And eye which gleams with inspiration--
5061	And farewell thou, my gloomy friend,
4978	And far removed from rumour vain;
4140	And fashionable magazines,
2972	And fashion's gay frivolities;
2883	And female tears hysterical,
 661	And fields my joys have ever been;
 242	And finally he deigns let fall
3544	And finally, upon his bed
4183	And fits of coughing racked her chest.By the sick lady's gaiety
4400	And fled afar--she followed me.
2827	And Flianoff, pensioned councillor,
3085	And Flianoff, somewhat indisposed,
3664	And flooded all the level ground.
3307	And flowed harmoniously. He took
 338	And following them ye might espy
4342	And for a time our course delay,
4068	And form a network left and right;
5024	And for Tattiana, mournful maid,
2457	And freezing fits of weariness.
 298	And from his dressing-room would pass
 622	And from the country all around
 559	And from the Millionaya afar
1476	And from the misty woodland nigh
4837	And frosty as a Twelfth Night cold.
1004	And full of innocent delight,
1671	And gallicisms I love as well
3064	And galloped home. But pistols twain,
4643	And gallops to her house away.
1109	And gave himself but little pain
2748	And gazed around with eyes of flame;
1761	And gently hovered o'er my head?
4298	And glasses unemployed all night;
3637	And glittering simpletons beside;Amid sly, pusillanimous
 539	And gloomy epigrams malicious.How oft, when on a summer night
4016	And golden Autumn draweth nigh,
1076	And gossip of the town and fashion
1093	And gradually day unfolds.
3875	And grant his weary bones their rest
4348	And grant success to labour long;
 409	And grasp a stirrup fortunate--
3305	And grasps a pen: his verse, albeit
2717	And grown more curious by far
1165	And had with waddling in the end
1407	And handsome countenance combined,
2079	And, hanging down her head, the maid
4826	And happy unto you appear.
5037	And hark! the clank of spurs is heard
1146	And harmony was soon restored.
 614	And hastened to his uncle's side,
1356	And hated casual visitors,
4319	And hates the world's discordant ways.
 161	And hat surnamed a "Bolivar"
4890	And heard a voice cry--_Why! He's killed!_--
 890	And Heavens! warbled forth we hear:
 946	And, heaving a regretful sigh,
4280	And heedless of approval seems,
4713	And he had made her heart beat quick!
4277	And her bespangled robe doth wave
 737	And herds of oxen wandering low;
2685	And her upon the threshold laid.Recovering, Tania gazes round;
2602	And her voice sweeter than the sounds
2384	And he waits dinner. Lenski comes,
2466	And he who, jealousy disarmed,
3757	And his poor basten sandal knits.
3098	And his strange conduct at the dance
3507	And homeward like an arrow tore.My friends, the poet ye regret!
2037	And honestly 'tis my belief
2732	And hoofs and crooked snouts and paws,
3050	And hot with jealous indignation,
3503	And hurried home his awful freight.
1962	And husbands' tedious amity?
1550	And I admired their common sense
4397	And I, amid the friendly crowd,
2400	And I confess that now-a-days
5073	And I discerned through Fancy's prism
3272	And if Tattiana mine had found--
 668	And impiously should declare,
1997	And in a vision, sinless, bright,
4333	And in a whisper did repeat:
1156	And in her conversation drawled.
1786	And in her grasp the letter shakes,
4426	And in her hand a French romance.
3879	And in her languid bosom raise
1631	And in her native language she
4989	And in society might shed
 569	And, inspiration firing me,
2608	And in the bathroom did command
1411	And in the final tome we learnt,
2739	And in the frosty night alone
1989	And in the morning doth not know
  42	And in the Summer Garden rove.
2611	And I, remembering Svetlana,
 455	And irrigate them with champagne;
4081	And irritates the appetite.
3688	And is all light within destroyed?
4454	"And is it long since back he came?
4576	"And is it she? It must be--no--
3607	And is it true and not a jest,
3605	And is it true her garland bright
 493	And isolated from all men,
4207	And I to give thee cakes was wont?"--
4656	And jests doth recapitulate.
3030	And jolting jarred the window-frames.
 276	And, joy of souls effeminate,
 920	And judgment which unsteady veers
4184	And kindness Tania was impressed,
 196	And Kniajnine, apt at copying.
2050	And leads a solitary life?
4267	And leaning 'gainst the portal closed
2643	And leans upon the monster's arm,
4731	And leave a marsh the fertile ground
1505	And led me off to church with song."
3438	And Lenski, closing his left eye,
2746	And Lenski followed--a light broke--
3163	And lessons to his children read.
 937	And life and fate in turn selected
4094	And like a palisade flit by.
4739	And like a shadow haunted her.
 468	And like Childe Harold gloomily
 646	And like his shadow dogged his life,
 909	And like Napoleons each of us
 549	And like the prisoner's our delight
 178	And Limburg cheese alive and old
3365	And linen on him doth bestow.
3437	And lo! five paces more they pass,
3236	And lo! he is already there!
3968	And lonely through the forest creeps.""Is she in love?" quoth one. "With whom?
1342	And long internal agitation
1948	And long perukes hath vanished.
2453	And love's delicious diadem
2110	And loves you as--a relative!Ahem! Ahem! My reader noble,
3737	And lo! where lies a marble tomb
2253	And madrigals I'm asked to write!
3685	And make a dark existence shine
2330	And many a caravan on high
2802	And many a day thereafter laid
 780	And many another slily sneered;
2888	And marking Tania's agitation,
 824	And marvels deemed he thus should view.
2366	And may fall headlong any time.
3573	And meditative from the spot
4628	And meditative homeward goes,
3251	And mental elasticity.
1023	And modest, cheerful as the morn,
 650	And more imagination teems.
4302	And Moscow many a beauty fair:
3824	And mourned him still. Why mourn his fate?'Twas eve. 'Twas dusk. The river speeds
 701	And my dark soul to light was brought;
  44	And my Eugene the path must trace--
5071	And my romance's open theme
2362	And naked uniformity.
1551	And natural benevolence,
4669	And necessary fools allowed.
1637	And never hath our language proud
4665	And never was the ear affright
2104	And no ridiculous report,
 761	And not a speck of dirt descried.
   4	And nothing more important sees;
3058	And now a fickle flirt and wild,
4891	And now he views forgotten foes,
 841	And now his youthful heart desires
3592	And now, I mournfully confess,
 840	And now philanthropy his soul,
 230	And now she skips and now she springs
1474	And now 'tis night, the guardian moon
4887	And now upon the snow in thaw
 563	And now we hear delightedly
 554	And o'er the granite coping bent,
1171	And oft at eventide a throng
1042	And of the attic. Honestly,
 256	And of the irksome harness tires,
4234	And oft in whispers would impart
 314	And oft its Dictionary thumb.
2397	And oh! what verses, what delights,
1527	And on the footstool sitting down
2225	And on the last one, underlined:
1228	And others rise ephemeral!
3197	And ought he not to disregard
1233	And our successors soon shall drive
4092	And our swift troikas never tire;
1954	And overcome antipathies
4017	And pallid nature trembling grieves,
3531	And past the threshold of decay,
 433	And pauses oft to serve out bread.
1902	And pelt him with cherries,
  12	And physic bring with mournful face,
4664	And platitudes and pedantry,
 445	And pleasure's daily blandishment,
3046	And pressed her hand--the crimson blush
2084	And privileges nice allowed,
4291	And rapid whirl of many feet,
4516	And reached, with nought his mind to engage,
2368	And read De Pradt or Walter Scott!
1630	And read our newspapers scarce ever,
3570	And reads with rapid eager eye
3624	And rest from bygone days of strife.But pause! Thou calm retreats, farewell,
2859	And ringing wine-glasses are plied.
1922	And rising from her bench proceeds;
2487	And roofs near morn blanched o'er with snow;
4562	And ruthless fashion hath blackballed.I like this word exceedingly
4917	And sallied forth one brilliant morn--
3070	And satisfied with vengeance ta'en.
2447	And saying this Vladimir drained
3177	And scanned in silence its content.
3299	And Schiller read by candlelight.
1322	And secretly their views expound.
2938	And seek in buzzing swarms the meads.
4972	And sermon--but in that dread hour
1430	And shall adopt some new caprice.
4497	And she at last hath us deceived;
1121	And she despite herself would waste
4305	And she to whom my lyre would fain,
2326	And shorter had the days become.
1524	And showed with an uncertain light
4856	And shut him in a lonely nook.He read as vainly as before,
1305	And silent as the maid Svetlana
1777	And silently I here must die--
4206	And since I pulled thee by the ear--
3492	And slowly life coagulates--
4820	And, sobbing at your feet, to blend
3189	And so departed. But Eugene,
2123	And so--God bless them, if He list.In this the love of the fair sex
1015	And solitude and calm delight,
2314	And solitude and calm delight.
3143	And sometimes into snares as well
4885	And soon imagination threw
2616	And soon Lel hovered o'er her head.
 600	And soon Oneguine's door beside
1179	And soon the friendly troop hath fled.They in a peaceful life preserved
1048	And so Tattiana was her name,
4151	And spectacles, his knitting staid
3308	And spouted it with lyric fire--
3630	And spur my spirit's torpid mood!
1535	And starting suddenly doth say:
1358	And stay whose length none recollects.
 257	And still the coachmen round the fires
 748	And stoves of various shapes abound.
1987	And straight returning whence he came,
3640	And stupid censors passionate;
2316	And such unconsciously he led,
2890	And sulked in silent indignation;
4433	And supercilious dames she glides,
2953	And supper. In the country we
2761	And swifter than the swallow's flight.
5038	And Tania's husband soon appeared.--
1445	And tears of reconciliation:
2292	And terrify a swarm of ducks,
2944	And testy gamesters do engage
2900	And that a bottle sealed with tar
1969	And that no longer could inspire.
4476	And that too often we receive
1368	And that unrivalled paragon,
3500	And the attendants called in haste.
1377	And the bad book accompanies.
3887	And the cast-iron statuette
2525	And the cold beauties of the season:
 641	And the conviction soon arose,
4439	And the dark fringe of men, like frames
4578	And the eternal lorgnette through
4346	And the extent of his caprice;
2130	And the fair sex as light as down!
2491	And the far mountains daintily
4370	And the heart's agitated dreams.
1353	And the kind-hearted servitors:
4326	And the lime alley's twilight dim
4245	And the lone secret of her heart,
1937	And the more surely we ensnare
2304	And then a cup of coffee drank,
4154	And the newcomers welcome bade.
 626	And then made merry pope and guest,
  35	And then "monsieur" supplied her place;
1143	And then she soon 'twixt work and leisure
1248	And then the stanzas of my theme
1722	And then to meditate for days
1571	And then with blind credulity
1518	And the old nurse a brief prayer said
 676	And the recesses of my mind
2840	And the sagacious Triquet back
4152	And the saloon threw open wide;
3931	And these the attentive maid observed
2821	And the Skatenines, aged pair,
 148	And the suspicious veteran old,
4371	And the world met her smilingly,
2197	And  they
3563	And the young damsel from the town,
2729	And the young girl appeared before
2533	And the young ladies fortunes told,
4395	And the young revellers of past times
4758	And they the waters recommend.He went not--sooner was prepared
3331	And think: here lies who loved me well,
3011	And this fifth canto ought to be
2134	And this the faithful one allows,
5080	And thou, from whom Tattiana sweet;
 458	And, though a plucky scatterbrain,
4596	And though her soul might be confused,
1696	And though I read it with distress,
 477	And though perchance a lady may
2073	And thoughtlessness to woe might lead."Thus did our friend Oneguine preach:
1011	And thoughts of Olga first impressed
5063	And thou, persistent to the end,
1460	And thou shalt taste the joys of earth.
3628	And thou, youth's early inspiration,
 326	And through the lofty windows views
1223	And thus ancestral dust reveres.
4806	And thus each stubbornly proceeds.
 498	And thus he never fell among
1975	And thus he spent eight years of time,
4725	And thus in season the rich field
1241	And thus it is 'twould cause me pain
1618	And thus secures the prey we seek.
1479	And thus unto her nurse did say:"Nurse, 'tis so close I cannot rest.
2395	And thy inebriating wave
1773	And thy protection I implore.
3639	And tiresome rogues ridiculous
3813	And to Oneguine far away
2935	And to revive Tattiana seemed.The chairs are thrust back with a roar,
 425	And to the Bourse the cabman plies;
3150	And to the field of honour led;
4997	And to these letters and these tears.
2320	And town and friends forgotten quite.This northern summer of our own,
1861	And traces with a slender finger
1416	And triumphs in career erotic.
3125	And true, his pistol's faultless aim
 175	And truffles, dear to youthful eyes,
3360	And turned aside the drapery;
3900	And turned to leave immediately,
3738	And two old pines their branches spread--
4493	And unto whom we all allude
 915	And usually despised it too),
4301	And vanish like a bird in air.Full many a lovely star hath night
3288	And various chords upon it proves,
4597	And vehemently though amazed
2711	And viewed the door with cunning eye.All bustle when he makes a sign:
4263	And views amongst themselves advance
1414	And Virtue acts as a narcotic,
 596	And visit many a foreign clime,
2229	And vows will probably be signed:
3346	And wakened him with the loud cry:
4552	And watch her eye's full glance to meet.
1726	And we--an unattractive set--
3060	And well-instructed to betray!
2638	And what from its recess appears?
1957	And what like menaces fatigues,
2183	And what resulted? Drunk with love,
2539	And what she from the cards inferred.
 608	And what the old man might bequeath.And in reality one day
4008	And what will Destiny concede?"Farther Tattiana's walks extend--
1082	And when for Olga nurse arrayed
 960	And when her violence reviewed--
1756	And when I prayer to Heaven addressed
 542	And when the watery mirror gleamed
4867	And where a madrigal occurs
1202	And where at last his bones repose
3580	And where may be her sister now?
1465	And wheresoe'er thy footsteps err,
3515	And where tempestuous love's desires,
4279	And where Thalia softly dreams
3512	And where the admirable streams
4411	And where the billows hoarsely raise
2143	And who is not a tiresome thief?
 105	And wholly occupied his day--
 956	And who the rent-roll of his race
4418	And wild among them grew her words--
4391	And wild festivities among
2703	And wildly waves its arms and storms;
2339	And wisely gallops to the hill.
 611	And wished to say to him farewell.
3997	And with emotional delight
4676	And with gray hair ambrosial
 604	And with his lot in life content,
3495	And with remorseful anguish filled,
1100	And would by candlelight arise.Romances pleased her from the first,
2109	And yet he in your cause would strive
2476	And yet oblivion forbade.
 487	And you, my youthful damsels fair,
1603	And you, O maids immaculate,
 931	And youthful madness, youthful fires.The gulf between them was so vast,
2017	An ear to my confession lend;
 850	An ever transcendental flight;
3110	A new acquaintance we must scan.
 292	A new Kaverine Eugene mine,
 798	A new proprietor arrived,
2873	Anew the flames of passion start
3916	A new world was made manifest!Although we know that Eugene had
 947	An exile from their troublous reign,
3100	An explanation: she was scared,
3949	Angel or fiend malevolent.
4974	An honourable course ye took,
4144	An hour passed by--another--till,
3854	Anicia soon appears, the door
3724	An idle anchorite and sad,
1071	An infant maiden doth exhort
 517	An innate love of meditation,
4074	An inn at every stage erect.But now, what wretched roads one sees,
4149	An invalid from lung complaint.
 165	Announcing to him dinner-time.
1126	A noted fop who gambled hard.Like his, her dress was always nice,
2512	Another bard with art divine
3762	Another could her heart engage,
3763	Another could her woe assuage
3820	Another his betrothed was given;
1838	Another passed; 'twas just the same.
1737	Another! to none other I
4683	Another tribune of the ball
4014	Another visit hastes to pay.
2694	Another with cock's head appeared,
4988	A notoriety proclaimed,
1312	An oval countenance and pink,
2461	A novel in Lafontaine's style,
2562	Anticipating woe she pined,
 509	Antiquity no pleasure gave,
 816	A nursling yet for Hope to school.
3065	A pair of bullets--nought beside--
 365	A pair; though desolate my mind,
   5	A paragon of virtue he!
3355	A passing snowstorm wreathed away
4819	A passionate desire to bend
4425	A pensive sorrow in her glance
3114	A philosophic anchorite:
4316	A pillar by, two aunts betwixt,
3880	A pleasure though with sorrow knit:
4132	Appear; along the road of Tver
1570	Appear attuned to softer chords;
2901	Appeared, Don's effervescing boast,
 199	Applause, the people's donative.
3335	Approach, approach; I am thine own."Thus in a style _obscure_ and _stale_,
3019	Approaches Olga and the pair
1907	Approach not to gaze at
1905	Approach not to hearken
1705	A print without the picture's grace,
1019	A promenade in twilight late
5003	A prudent man like you and brave
 381	Are admirable, my dear friend,
2111	Are all your relatives quite well?
2212	A register of fleeting thought,
2511	Are not with elegance impressed.
 420	Are oft deceptive--like their feet.Where is Oneguine? Half asleep,
2736	Are turned upon her. All combine
 209	Are ye replaced by other maids
3861	A riding whip. She strolls along.
2585	A ring she heard the ancient strain:
3553	A rivulet beneath them shoots
2662	Around her neck, now violently
 706	Around my stanzas incomplete
3797	Around the carriage of the pair--
2080	Around the garden homeward hies.
2182	Around the meadow and the grove.
2927	Aroused in him some tenderness.
1994	Aroused in him sweet reverie.
4191	Aroused Tattiana from her bed.
1796	Arouses rustics from their sleep.
1894	Arouse yourselves, fair ones.
 136	Arrange without the least delay--
1271	A Russian household simple quite,
3952	A Russian in Childe Harold's cloak,
4901	A Russian poem's mechanism
 855	As a babe's slumber, or the light
1024	As a poetic life serene,
2937	As bees who leave their dainty store
2470	As butterflies to blossoms cling.
 867	A scant attendance Lenski showed
1655	A schoolmaster in yellow shawl
 907	As cyphers others to appraise,
4193	As daylight glimmers, darkness flits,
4221	As deaf and silly doth remain,
2468	As drunken tramps at nightfall sleep,
 876	A sense of social delight,
1662	As every journal now entreats,
1669	As formerly much agitation.
3756	As formerly the shepherd sits
3015	As giddy youth's hilarity--
2698	A shape half cat and half a crane.Yet ghastlier, yet more wonderful,
3241	As hope uncertain and as sweet,
4840	A sidelong look doth Eugene dart:
3569	Aside she casts her veil of gauze
3424	Aside the foes their mantles threw,
1850	As if he cruelly had joked!'Twas dusk! Upon the table bright
 671	As if impossible it were
2688	As if it were some funeral feast.
3074	As if some troubled dream she dreamed.
4026	As if with eider-down is filled.
3559	A simple tombstone hath been set.There, when the rains of spring we mark
4358	As in a garden when I grew,
1005	As in a thicket's humble shade,
1371	A single being: 'twas in fine
1335	As in her heart the thought sank home,
3408	As in some frenzied dream of fear
2068	As in their turn the seasons roll.
1053	As in the timid forest deer,
3294	As it were, tore himself away.
 185	A slave of actresses capricious,
 742	As lordly mansions ought to be,
2958	As many dinners I rehearse,
 155	As many entertainments be!
 628	As men who much had done that day.
3665	A smile from slumbering nature clear
2959	As oft to meat and drink advert,
  58	A something somehow have obtained,
3594	As once, to fill the rapid page
4889	As one who bivouacs afield,
 551	As on the rapid wings of thought
2030	As partner of my mournful days,
2153	A spirit which for sorrow yearned.
1921	A sportsman who in covert lies.But finally she heaves a sigh,
1657	As rosy lips without a smile,
5077	As Saadi anciently averred--
1173	Assemble from the neighbourhood:
4441	Assemblies oligarchical
3077	Assigned a lodging, from the hall
2409	Assistance ever will extend,
4730	As storms which in chill autumn rage
3201	Assuredly should not have been
4196	A stable, kitchen, fence appeared.To consanguineous dinners they
3924	As the reflection of his age,
1672	As the sins of my youthful days
 854	As thoughts which gentle maidens have,
2960	As thou, great Homer, didst of yore,
4494	As to a worthy man and good!But sad is the reflection made,
2625	A stream, by winter's ice unbound,
2947	A strong resemblance these possess--
1022	A substitute for lamps we hail!Obedient she had ever been
3403	Asunder was and hate prepared?
4722	As vernal storms the fields athwart.
1899	As we lure the young gallant,
2161	As when the tempest's veil is drawn
1547	As Winter in their purity,
4104	As with innumerable fires.
3279	As yet none had discovered aught;
 380	As your light footprints on the green.Diana's bosom, Flora's cheeks,
2383	A table to the fire is brought,
2887	At a great feast against desire,
2679	A tangled wilderness around.
4147	At an old aunt's they had arrived
3427	At each extreme one takes his stand,
3905	At early morn returns the maid
3199	At eighteen not to play the fool!
2211	A tender couplet he combined,
1182	Ate Russian pancakes at Shrovetide,
3749	At eventide would hither come,
4489	At fifty who relief obtained
 536	At first, but soon became inured
3912	At first for books was disinclined,
1714	At first, I clung to secrecy:
 899	At first such contradictions wrought
3542	At forty suffered from the gout,
 739	A thick immense neglected grove
3478	At his pale brow a shot to have,
3432	Athwart the snow four paces came--
1566	A timid love to banishment?--
3196	A timid, shrinking love to grieve.
1318	At Larina's abode produced
1265	"At Larina's."--"Hem, that is queer!
  32	At last became a ruined man.
3606	At last is shrunk and withered quite?
1502	At last my father gave his blessing,
2866	At last the author!" cries Mamma.
1568	At least by show of sympathy;
1569	At least their accents and their words
2375	At morn an icy bath within
2181	At morn, hand clasped in hand, they rove
4809	At morn I must assuredly
 868	At neighbouring hospitalities.
2206	A tombstone, Aphrodite's shrine,
1085	At prisoner's base she never played.
4228	A trifle pale, a trifle lean,
2721	A trouble fell upon the sprites;
3586	A true account and in detail.But not at present, though sincerely
2373	A true Childe Harold my Eugene
1629	At Russ she was by no means clever
2299	At seven in summer rose from bed,
4569	At table she was sitting by
 301	Attend in male attire arrayed.On this artistical retreat
 347	Attentive be unto my rhymes
2075	Attentive listened to his speech,
 944	Attentive listened to the lad.But more the passions occupy
1909	Attentive to the echoing sound,
 134	Attentive to the heart's first beating,
3904	At the front gates, but in brief space
1099	At the same hour she oped her eyes
4488	At thirty who was married well,
4903	At this time almost understood.
1718	At times, if only once a week,
1776	At times my reason almost bends,
3148	At times talk nonsense with design;
4748	At times three words to him addressed
3147	At times to silence would resort,
1702	Attractive in its banefulness?
4487	At twenty who was prig or swell,
3062	At womankind he growled a curse,
1961	Aunts, mothers and their scrutiny,
2758	Aurora's ruddy rays of light--
1401	Authors replete with sacred fire
4712	Autocrat of the drawing-room seek?
3132	A valuable hostage gained,
1420	A Vampire fond of meditation,
2892	Avenge himself in proper style.
4523	A very troublesome disease,
4018	A victim decked with golden leaves;
3834	A village and beneath, a wood,
4511	A visionary mortified,
3927	A visionary personage
4448	A vision desolate and drear
 133	Avowal then 'twas time to pray,
 583	Awaiting on the shore I roam
 132	Await the long-delayed caress.
4689	Awakens secret merriment
 415	Away! and cease to ring their praise
2663	Away her golden earrings tore;
3801	Away, Tattiana, hath been ta'en.
2332	A weary season was at hand--
3725	A while ago the winter spent,
4662	Awhile sound conversation seems
1968	Awhile this beauty captivated,
4536	A whisper runs along the hall,
4023	A white and undulating pall
 809	A wild enthusiastic tongue,
2702	A windmill too a jig performs
4522	A wish from place to place to roam,
 803	A worshipper of Kant, a bard,
2148	A worthy object 'tis, and well
4704	Aye bids ye in some way or other--
 804	A young and handsome galliard.
 403	A young Armida's lips to press,
4888	A young man motionless he saw,
3788	Back to his regiment must roam.
4050	Baggage is heaped up in a mound,
4141	Balconies, lion's heads on doors,
1155	Baptized Prascovia Pauline,
3656	            Baratynski
1680	Bard of the "Feasts," and mournful breast,
2521	Bard of the Finnish maiden young.
1472	Barely to draw her breath she seems,
2704	Barking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse,
2813	Barking, young ladies' osculations,
4043	Basins and jugs--well! everything
2686	Bear gone--she at the threshold placed;
2124	Beats that of friends and relatives:
 500	Because a member I became.Once more to idleness consigned,
 453	Because he could not gourmandise
1577	Because her passion wanted art,
 753	Because he yawned at the bare view
1574	Because in singleness of thought
2235	Because I should be sure, meanwhile,
4985	Because my lord, in battles maimed,
1579	Because she was so innocent,
1735	Become a faithful wife and e'en
2612	Become alarmed. So never mind!
3076	Bedding is laid out and to all
4278	Before a cold indifferent crowd,
4083	Before a fire which feebly glows
 865	Before he eighteen years attained.Since Eugene in that solitude
1926	Before her straight with roguish eyes.
4886	Before him her wild game of chance.
 174	Before him red roast beef is seen
 733	Before it ran a stream. Behold!
3250	Before such fond simplicity
3767	Before the altar, lo! the pair,
5084	Before the dregs they shall divine
4615	Before whom once in solitude,
2570	Before whose inexperienced sight
4799	Before you agonized to die--
3022	Begins to talk of this and that,
4538	Behind her a grave general.
2903	Behind, of glasses an array,
3399	Behind the mill. Meantime ye see
3895	Behind the mountain sank the moon.
4045	Behold! beside their dwelling groups
2943	Behold! green tables are brought forth,
3770	Behold her downcast eyes which glow,
3390	"Behold my friend Monsieur Guillot;
1510	Behold, my sobs I scarce restrain--"
2218	Behold! orthography despising,
2350	Behold! than polished floor more nice
4535	Behold, the crowd begins to stir,
4670	Behold the dames who once were fine
1523	Behold! the moon was shining bright
3215	Behold! the world's opinion!
3948	Being from hell or heaven sent,
2537	Believed, the people's wisdom weird,
1715	Believe me, of my present shame
3158	Beneath acacias, cherry-trees,
5018	Beneath a cross and shrubbery.
2617	Beneath her downy pillow placed,
4195	Beneath her lay a strange courtyard,
1006	Beneath her parents' eyes the maid
3104	Beneath her roaring opened wide:
  11	Beneath his head the pillow smooth,
4952	Beneath his lips' devouring kiss.
2273	Beneath the eyes of ladies bright
 958	Beneath the flag of Quietude,
1097	Beneath the moon which dimly shines,
1000	Beneath the sheltering oak tree's shade
3829	Beneath the silver of the moon
 389	Beneath the table-cloth of white,
3883	Beneath the window-sill his bed,
3722	Beside a nameless rivulet,
3258	Beside his Olga doth he grieve,
1528	Beside our youthful heroine fair,
3209	Besides, a duellist well-known
2131	Besides the hobbies of a spouse
4394	Beside the cup she sang her rhymes
 394	Beside the stormy sea one day
2631	Beside the thundering abyss
2485	Betimes, and sees, when morning breaks,
2191	Better than Chateaubriand did
 663	Between myself and my Eugene,
2902	Between the blanc-mange and the roast;
 235	Between the stalls, along the toes;
4893	Bevies of treacherous maidens young;
3716	Beyond the city-barriers haste.Thou also, reader generous,
2227	Beyond this may attempt to write_.Infallibly you there will find
2382	Billiards abandoned, cue forgot,
 810	Black curls which to his shoulders hung.
4673	Blank, unapproachable and cold.
3321	Blest be the labours of the light,
4137	Bokharians, peasants, beds of greens,
 511	Books he abandoned like the fair,
1276	"Boredom, my friend, behold the ill--"
2101	Born of a babbler in a loft
4331	Both aunts looked knowing as a judge,
2658	Both bush and brake, ravine and steep,
4734	Both day and night he now must pass
3162	Both ducks and geese in plenty bred
 281	Both for the nails and for the tushes.
2261	Both natural and truthful seemed.
 524	Both were expectant of the hate
 521	Both were of passion satiate

3417	Bullets are down the barrels pressed,
2199	Buried in meditation deep,
  89	But Adam Smith to read appeared,
3172	But, after mutual compliments,
4194	But ah! discerns nor wood nor mead--
1107	But, as he never opened them,
3157	But, as I said, Zaretski mine
2982	But as to fighting--'twill appear!
4727	But at a later, sterile age,
3846	But at her shriek ran forth with noise
 374	But better loved the soft repose
1784	But boldly I myself resign:
1533	But borne in spirit far away
2860	But by degrees the crowd begin
3003	But by fantastic dreams distraught,
2648	But cannot anyhow evade
  28	But cannot stand the northern cold.
2519	But competition I abjure
1128	But contrary to her advice
4609	But could not. Then she questioned him:--
3381	"But," cried Zaretski in amaze,
3106	"But death from him will be delight.
2689	But deeming all this nonsense pure,
2852	But dinner-time comes. Two and two
2169	But enough! Now, 'tis my intent

3359	But finally he oped his eyes
1447	But finally in wedlock bind.
4955	But finally she softly said:

3387	But followed the strict rules of art,
3214	But fools--their calumnies and sneers"--

3480	But home his body to despatch
4399	But I abandoned their array,
1552	But, I acknowledge, from them fled;
5031	But I am now another's bride--
1778	But I await thee: scarce alive
2014	But I came not to adulate:
1711	But if my lot unfortunate
  71	But if the truth I must relate,
 700	But I, in love, was mute and dull.The Muse appeared, when love passed by
3127	But I must add to what I write
1674	But I must now employ my Muse
 615	But in his heart dissatisfied,
4250	But in the drawing-room all appeared
1507	But I perceive thou dost not heed--"
3892	But it grew late; cold blew the gale;
3291	But it grew late; he must not stay;
1827	But I was sharp in times gone by.
1665	But I--what is all this to me?
2934	But kindness from his eye had beamed
4781	But, knowing not the actual truth,
 892	But Lenski, having no desire
1282	But Lenski, I should be so glad
2254	But Lenski madrigals ne'er wrote

1425	Could in romantic mantle drape
 283	Could not conceive how serious Grimm
4575	Could not eclipse her neighbour's light."And is it," meditates Eugene.
4936	Could not in that brief moment guess!
4099	Could taste the pleasures of the road.

  48	Cropped in the latest style his hair,
 427	Crunching the morning snow she treads;
2811	Crush and confusion in the hall,
 335	Crushing and a confusing noise;
3059	Cunning already to display
4848	Cursing his own stupidity,
3184	Curtly announcing for the fray

3876	Deep in our mother Earth's chill breast!"Tattiana's eyes with tender gleam
4617	Deep in the distant province rude,
3995	Deep in the greenwood far away?Arising with the morning's light,
  30	Deep into debt his father ran;
4437	Deliberate approach of guests
4003	Delicious nature, thee I fly,
2398	Delicious visions, jests and fights!Alas! my stomach it betrays
3257	Delighted, almost sane in mind.But once more pensive and distressed
2237	Delighted glances in return;

4831	Epistle second, note the third,
1959	Epistles of six sheets or near,
3174	Ere conversation could begin,
3412	Ere crimson stains their hands defile,
2556	Ere the bright messenger had set.
3459	Ere this but one brief moment beat
4869	_E sempre bene_, gentlemen!
1900	Espy him approaching,
3018	Espying, Eugene with a smile
2093	Esteemed him much as the world goes.
2798	Et cetera_; but nothing showed
4505	Eternally to imitate
 770	Eugene at first began to dream,
 595	Eugene designed with me to start
3367	Eugene directs the trusty man
4940	Eugene fell prostrate at her feet--
 318	Eugene in hackney carriage placed.
 913	Eugene, more tolerant than this
3280	Eugene of course related nought,
1992	Eugene was touched with sympathy;
 948	Eugene would speak regarding these.
1040	Euphonious, though I know a spice
4260	Even amusing fools we miss
2085	Even as Moscow, city proud.Confess, O ye who this peruse,
1615	Even as the love of children dear.
1054	Even beneath her parents' roof
1787	Even the rosy wafer dries
3634	Eventually petrify
2773	Ever absorbed a maid so much:
1404	Ever by adverse fate oppressed,
4201	Ever receive with kindly hearts
1953	Ever to hear the same replies
1941	Everywhere trumpeting its feats,
4036	Examined, mended, newly found
4225	Examine her from head to foot.
 916	Exceptionless as no rule is,
3091	Except one by the window placed
 245	Exclaiming, "We must change 'em all!
1621	Excruciate the heart and late
2290	Exhausted by my woes and rhymes,
1170	Existence calmly sped along,
 954	Existence without wife or friends,
  85	Existence would not make a curse,
 835	Exist--that their immortal band
 740	Extended--haunt which Dryads love.
 523	Extinct the flame which once had fired;
 708	Extinguished ashes do not blaze--
4668	Faces which we meet everywhere
2906	Fair object of my guileless lay,
1284	Fair source of every fine idea,
 261	Faithfully shall I now depict,
3760	Faithless, alas! thy maid appears,
 114	False confidence or doubt to impart,
4581	Familiar to him long ago.
1462	Fantastic images shall swarm
4355	'Fare thee well, and if for ever,
1013	Farewell! thou golden days of love!
 111	Far from his Italy--his own.
2196	Far from the rest the pair would creep
1392	Farthingales, patches, were the thing,
3037	Fashion is there immutable,
2818	Fat Poustiakoff drove to the door;
  38	Fearing his pupil to annoy,
4042	Feather-beds, also poultry-coops,
 918	Feeling in others much esteemed.With smiling face he Lenski hears;
 912	Feeling is silly, dangerous.
2012	Feelings which long had ceased to be
 832	Felled a calumniator base!
3235	Finally tost his arms in air
1137	First reconciled and then content;
 176	Flanked by immortal Strasbourg pies,
3671	Flew to collect his rural tax;
 329	Flies past the porter to the stair,
3631	Fly frequent to my solitude,
5048	Foeman or friend, I do aspire
 135	Follow up love--a secret meeting
 343	Fond declarations they invite
4510	For a fictitious misanthrope,
 598	For a protracted space of time.
2403	For Ay is like a mistress fair,
4680	For baseness of the spirit scorns,
3332	For consecrate to me he fell
1075	For dolls, e'en from her earliest years,
  84	For empty sound the rascal swore he
4471	For ever carps, condemns, pursues?
5032	For ever faithful will abide."
3452	For evermore had disappeared.
3805	For evermore is separate.
 416	For ever with thy tattling lyre,
4113	For every loyal Russian breast!
5027	For ever your Tattiana leave.
  34	For first "madame" his wants observed,
4314	For folly's dues thou hadst to pay.Noise, laughter, bowing, hurrying mixt,
3194	For, from the outset, 'twas unjust
2174	Forgive me! Such the love I bear
 930	Forgive the fever youth inspires,
1280	For God's sake, Lenski, don't begin!
1729	Forgotten in the village lone,
4328	Forgot the world, the noisy ball,
3477	For him an honourable grave,
  80	For him were but of little worth,
1499	For I myself was thirteen quite;
 721	For journalistic deglutition
 653	For law I _far niente_ take
3072	For Lenski, sought him with her eyes,
5042	For long--for ever. To be sure
2885	For long he had endured them all.
2194	For maiden's hearing deemed unfit),
3992	For Moscow fops and Circes each
5012	For my wild garden and bookcase,--
3341	For o'er a word to fashion known,
1553	For on their brows I trembling read
 352	For otherwise--God only knows!
 271	For our amusement ever made
4091	For our Automedons are fire
2983	For patience, reader, I must plead!
 384	For promises her feet reveal
3617	For riot, frolics, mighty feeds,
 648	For rural solitude and dreams,
4420	For savage speech, uncouth and strange,
2670	For shame lift up the modest maid.
3564	For summer to the country flown,
 266	For tallow, wood and other things
3418	For the first time the hammer clicks.
4126	For the impatient chief instead.
3729	For there he left a mournful trace.
2389	For the young poet they display.
 226	Forth from the crowd of nymphs surrounding
2499	Forth the _kibitka_ gallops swift,
 451	For treachery had done its worst;
3526	Fortune the poet had repaid.
2434	For twice you came to them and yet
2046	For us, may be for many a year.
4998	For visions of my childish years
3816	For was it not her duty to
3696	For which no springtime shall appear?
 108	For which the poet agonized
1949	For who imposture can endure,
1546	For whom, Tattiana, is it meant?I have known beauties cold and raw
2113	For your instruction here to tell
1144	Found out the secret how at pleasure
2028	Found the ideal of my youth,
2180	Found them in darkness side by side,
3433	Four deadly paces do they span;
 941	Fragments of northern poetry,
 443	Free, in the blossom of his spring,
 702	Free, I renewed the idolatry
 238	Free scope he yields unto his glance,
4579	Frequent and rapid doth his glance
1446	Fresh cause of quarrel then I'll find,
1892	Friends and companions,
 452	Friendship and friends he likewise curst,
2295	Friends, I must your indulgence pray.
  19	Friends of Liudmila and Ruslan,
 834	Friends of the sons of every land,
4096	From apprehension of the cost,
4288	From boxes or from stalls in rows.To the assembly her they bear.
5051	From careless stanzas such as these,
4787	From everything the heart held dear
2217	From first to last page to the rim.
 732	From gales a hill behind was seen;
 802	From Gottingen inspired he came,
2933	From habit or maliciously,
1870	From hall to yard and garden flies,
1364	From happy inspiration flow,
4127	From hence engrossed in thought profound
1771	From henceforth I confide to thee!
1791	From her half-open vest of night.
 579	From her my lips shall learn the tongue
 502	From mere vacuity of mind
4490	From public and from private ties,
  83	From Romulus unto our day.
 529	From shades of the relentless past.
3159	From storms protection having sought,
3012	From such digressions wholly free.
3226	From the dread pistol turn away.
2909	From the moist cork the bottle freed
 799	From whose analysis minute
 491	From you too Eugene took to flight,
2592	Frosty the night; the heavens shone;
1380	Fruit of the yearnings of the heart.
2396	Full many a foolish prank brought forth;
 339	Full many a glance like lightning flash,
4651	Full of exasperating thought.
 624	Funeral amateurs abound!
2723	Furious he from the table rose;
4315	Gallop, mazurka, waltzing--see!
4726	Gay flowers and luscious fruit doth yield.
3450	Gazed on him, called him. Useless care!
3295	Gazing into his face, she said:
3496	Gazing on Lenski's corse did stand--
4933	Gazing upon a note below.
  41	Gently for pranks he would reprove
 866	Gifts such as these alone could prize,
2851	Girls in anticipation skip!
2591	Girls the _kashourka_ much prefer.
2427	Give me just half a glass of wine--
4090	Glides with a more luxurious ease;
3043	Gliding in negligent career,
2322	Glimmers and dies. This is well known,
5072	Glittered in a perspective long,
4369	Glory with which our history teems
 857	Goddess of lovers' tender sighs.
1653	God grant I meet not at a ball
5056	God grant that all who herein glance,
3468	God knows! The very trace is lost.'Tis sweet the foe to aggravate
3874	God save his soul eternally
3721	Go hear the rustling of the oaks
1262	"Good-bye, Oneguine, I must go."--
3319	Good governs all! The hour draws nigh
1539	Good-night." Behold! she is alone!
 723	Go, on the Neva's bank appear,
4350	Grant that I err not on the road."
2751	Grasped a long knife and instantly
 730	Grateful to Heaven for their lot.
1073	Gravely repeating to another
 830	Great sacrifices for his sake!
3048	Grew brighter still. But Lenski hath
1007	Grew like a lily pure and white,
3660	    Griboyedoff
3633	Grow harsh and cruel, dead and dry,
2665	Grown clammy, stick fast in the snow;
2163	Grows pale and sinks, but nothing says;
1881	Guards fondly hope's uncertain dream.
3423	Guillot behind a pollard stood;
2819	Gvozdine, a landlord excellent,
3084	Gvozdine, Bouyanoff, Petoushkoff
1138	Habit was given us in distress
2040	Habit would bring indifference.
1965	Had a deluded victim been
3946	Had bid her sigh for without hope--
 623	Had come both friends and enemies--
1343	Had filled her youthful breast with gloom,
3545	Had finished life amid his sons,
4610	"Had he been long here, and where from?
1495	Had killed me had the like been told."
 863	Had let fall many a bitter tear:
3188	Had much to do at home that day,
 812	Had not yet withered his young breast.
3530	Had perished a creative mind,
3277	Had reconciled the pair anew!
4770	Had rendered him an invalid;
2560	Had run across her path at speed,
1646	Had to compose in secret rhymes,
1297	Hallo, Andriushka, onward race!
3954	Handbook of fashionable phrase
4022	Hangs heavy on the oaken boughs,
2589	Happy and glorious_. But this brings
5083	Happy who quit life's banquet seat
 694	Happy who thereto can unite
4482	Happy who timely grew mature,
1306	Hard by the window took her place."--
 480	Harmless, but quite nonsensical.
3370	Harnessed the rapid sledge arrived:
1225	Harvests of souls unceasingly
3109	Haste, haste thy lagging pace, my story!
 448	Hateful the hollow world became,
2059	Hath fate apportioned unto thee
4484	Hath gradually learnt to endure;
3210	Hath mixed himself in the affair,
2513	Hath pictured in his gorgeous line
3956	Hath she a fitting phrase selected?
 950	Hath suffered but indifferent grown,
3777	Hath the bard, by indifference blest,
4492	Hath tranquilly in turn attained,
4402	Hath whiled the road's monotony,
 116	Haughty appear, subservient,
3524	Have echoed to eternity.
1595	Have e'er a precious tress consigned,
3325	Have entered never to return.
1598	Have felt love's agitated kiss
4923	Have guessed already. Yes, quite so!
 476	Have latterly vexatious grown;
5088	Have my Oneguine--suddenly.
4500	Have one by one all withered grown
  26	Have shone as one of fashion's leaders.
2232	Have smuggled his flagitious lay.
4349	Having a trusty staff bestowed,
 616	Having for money's sake alone
2575	Having lost all in life we prize.
 302	Having once fixed your interest,
  29	Having performed his service truly,
3067	Having remarked Vladimir's flight,
 612	Having this mournful document
4635	He a polite reply doth scrawl.
3056	Heard he the truth? And thus she could--
3775	Hearing the fatal perfidy?
1693	Hears not my importunity!
4259	Heart would not throb albeit in jest--
3899	Heaved an involuntary sigh
3292	Heavy his heart with anguish grew;
4930	He back as from a sudden blow?--
3044	He bending whispered in her ear
 170	He bends his course to Talon's, where
4907	He "Benedetta" used to hum,
2928	He bowed to her nor silence broke,
 805	He brought from mystic Germany
1995	He called to mind Tattiana's grace,
4169	He called upon me Christmas Eve--
3108	He _cannot_ give me happiness."
3187	He cared no longer there to stay,
4608	He conversation would have led--
3145	He could in disputation shine
4738	He daily in his drives drew near
3237	He deemed his coming would inspire
 829	He deemed his friends but longed to make
 821	He deemed of human life the goal
2676	He dragged her by a forest road
2712	He drinks, all drink and loudly call;
3442	He drops his pistol silently.He on his bosom gently placed
3494	Heedless of your despairing cry?Eugene, his pistol yet in hand
2847	He enters. Ah! good news to-day!
 172	He enters. High the cork arose
 332	He enters: in the hall a crowd,
 883	He enters: rapidly discussion
4928	He enters the saloon. 'Tis blank!
3371	He enters: to the mill he drives:
3252	He eyed her with a fond concern,
3223	He feared the criminal might try
 501	He felt the laudable desire
 459	He finally lost all delight
4652	He fixedly upon her stares--
 620	He found him on the table laid,
2839	He found them in an almanac,
3129	He from his Kalmuck horse did leap
3361	He gazed upon the clock which showed
3919	He had excepted from the ban:
4457	He has returned, say in what guise?
   3	He hath acquired the world's esteem
1844	"He hath neglected us of late."--
1973	He heard his soul's complaint within,
 162	He hies unto the "Boulevard,"
4852	He in imagination saw
1964	He in the early years of life
  56	He is a charming youth and wise.
3839	He is not there: I am not known:
 846	He kindled his poetic flame.
4520	He knew not how to spend his life.
2714	He knits his brows--'tis silent all.
 171	He knows Kaverine will repair.
2506	He laughs, although it aches from cold,
 474	He left _you_ first, and I must own
2204	He leisurely adorns for her.
3491	He lies, upon his forehead death,
3362	He long should have been on the road.He rings in haste; in haste arrives
3138	He loved the simpleton to mock,
4915	He marmot-like did hibernate,
3261	He mused: "I will her saviour be!
 324	He nears a spacious mansion's gate,
3532	He ne'er shall hear Time's eulogy,
 631	He now a full possession takes,
4762	He obstinately will remain,
2641	He offers her his murderous paw;
 924	He oft upon his lips would curb,
4128	He on the conflagration frowned.
3206	He ought to have conciliated
3511	He perished. Where his troubled dreams,
1846	"He promised here this day to ride,"
 823	He racked his brains to find its clue
2926	Her agitation and distress
1101	Her all in all did constitute;
4240	Her amorous experience
3991	Her antiquated mode of speech,
1470	Her bosom heaves whilst crimson hues
4601	Her bow was easy, unreserved.Ah no! no faintness her attacked
4603	Her brow she did not e'en contract
4212	Her cap of tulle still ever wears:
1166	Her caps and night-dresses to mend.As for her spouse he loved her dearly,
 404	Her cheek of rosy loveliness
4935	Her cheek reclines upon her hand.Oh! who her speechless agonies
3673	Herds low, and under night's dark veil
 505	He reads at random, reads in vain.
4860	He read the unbelieving Bayle,
2695	Here an old witch with hirsute beard,
 764	Here bottles stand in close array,
4118	Here, drunk with his late victory,
4168	"Here, he resides with Simeon.
 667	Herein my portrait should detect,
4541	Her eyes no saucy glance address,
1026	Her eyes were of cerulean blue,
1473	Her eye with fire unwonted gleams.
4543	Her features no grimaces bleared;
4310	Her feet the earth beneath her press!
2430	Her figure perfect grows with time!
 410	Her foot was in my other hand.
4218	Her friend Monsieur Finemouche the same,
4325	Her garden, and those books of hers,
 999	Her girlish gaiety and sport.
4312	Her glance how wild yet genial!
1125	Her Grandison was in the Guard,
3052	Her hand for the cotillon prays.
2666	Her handkerchief she loses now;
1789	Her head upon her breast declines
2157	Her health, life's sweetness and its bloom,
4311	Her heart how full of gentleness,
3814	Her heart importunately turns.
3103	Her heart: it seemed a darksome pit
3837	Her heart more loudly and more fleet.She hesitates, in doubt is thrown--
4926	Her house he enters, ghastly white,
1120	Her husband was a bridegroom then,
3097	Her inmost soul had penetrated,
1938	Her in the pitfalls which we place.
3771	Her lips where light smiles come and go!
1027	Her locks were of a golden hue,
4539	Her manners were deliberate,
2799	Her Martin Zadeka in aid,
3984	Her money counted, and designed
1118	Her Moscow cousin, often told
1028	Her movements, voice and figure slight,
3282	Her nurse, who could have made a guess,
2640	He roars, and "Ah!" Tattiana cries.
2743	Her on a shaky bench sit down;
2379	He round the billiard-table stalked,
1379	Her passion's faithful counterpart,
3831	Her path across the plain doth keep--
4386	Her promptings unto law did make,
4246	Her sacred hoard of joy and tears,
2523	Herself not knowing well the reason,
1162	Her sentimental verses all,
2649	Her shaggy myrmidon in chase.
2745	Her shoulder--Olga swiftly came--
4033	Her shoulders, breast and face to lave--
4282	Her sisterhood delights the young
2158	Her smile and maidenly repose,
4013	Her spacious fields and shady groves,
4429	Her steppe-like beauties I peruse
1501	Her suit before my parents pressing:
1526	Her tears and her dishevelled hair;
4934	Her tears flow plentifully and
4266	Her the ideal which he dreamed,
3990	Her toilette's antiquated style,
4233	Her tresses curled in fashion saw,
4377	Her utterances ever heard,
1865	Her weary eyes are filled with tears--
4550	Her with a smile old women greet,
4219	Her wolf-dog and her husband tame;
 792	He's a freemason, so we think.
4619	He salutary rules poured forth?
 864	He sang of life's fresh colours stained
 858	He sang of separation grim,
3394	He's a straightforward little chap."
2376	He sat, and then the livelong day,
2463	He seemed for matrimony born.He was beloved: or say at least,
1878	"He's here! Eugene is here!
 869	He shunned those parties boisterous;
2713	He smiles, in laughter all combine;
2195	He somewhat blushing would omit:
1978	He still made love in a queer way;
1986	He takes his seat, concludes his game,
2715	He there is master--that is plain;
2464	He thought so, and existence charmed.
 495	He thought to write, but labour long
 639	He took no more the slightest heed;
 755	He took the room wherein the old
 469	He to the festival repairs,
4768	He used to hate--and was no fool--
3168	He usually was glad to see
4631	He wakes--they with a letter come--
1691	He wanders in his indolence;
 782	He was a dangerous fool indeed.
 815	He was a dear delightful fool--
1201	He was an honest gentleman,
3239	He was deceived. Just as before
3349	He was in error; for Eugene
3164	He was no fool, and Eugene mine,
3451	He was no more! The youthful bard
4897	He well-nigh lost the use of sense,
 632	He who economy abhorred,
 528	He who hath suffered ofttimes shrinks
4483	He who life's frosts which early wrung
2588	He whom we sing to shall be made
2516	He will delight you, I am sure,
 978	He with an innocence extreme
1001	He with his little maiden played,
 998	He witnessed tenderly and moved
2221	Hewn, hacked, and otherwise ill-used.
3385	He would not that a man ye slay
1222	He writes upon his parents' tomb,
  51	He wrote and spoke, so all allowed,
3336	He wrote ('tis the romantic style,
 244	He yawns, averts his countenance,
 576	Hid in the gondola's dark shade,
4067	Highways all Russia will unite
4521	Him a disquietude did seize,
3144	Himself just like a greenhorn fell.
2504	Himself transformed into a hack;
2708	Him who inspired both love and awe,
2178	His ardent soul with full delight.
2077	His arm he offers. Mute and sad,
3506	His bit with foam besprinkled o'er,
 512	His book-shelf instantly doth drape
3457	His breast was riddled through and through,
3471	His butting horns in anger bent,
3297	His care unto his pistols' plight,
2868	His chair, plate, knife and fork in haste;
4914	His chambers close wherein confined
 516	His character attracted me.
 203	His comedies, a noisy rout,
 995	His constant soul could ever tire,
2301	His course unto the running brook.
2448	His cup unto his maiden dear.
2296	His daily occupations, lo!
1110	His daughter's book to ascertain
 853	His ditties were as pure and bright
4916	His double sashes and his grate,
2260	His elegies, which plenteous streamed,
3929	His energy and impotence.And numerous pages had preserved
2865	His entrance with Oneguine. "Ah!
4874	His eyes, the printed lines betwixt,
3066	His fate shall presently decide.
2747	His fist Oneguine fiercely shook
2365	His footing on the treacherous rime
3363	His Frenchman, good Monsieur Guillot,
2092	His friends and also enemies
 515	His friendship I acquired just then;
 168	His furs are powdered on the way
4721	His gusts should fertilize, amend,
3443	His hand, and fell. His clouded eye
 843	His harp beneath that sky had rung
 953	His hate by slander, and who spends
2744	His head sinks slowly, rests upon
 813	His heart reciprocated still
2303	His Hellespont from bank to bank,
 757	His housekeeper was wont to scold,
3925	His immorality of mind
 979	His inner consciousness laid bare,
4873	His intellect in close array.
4949	His kneeling posture he retains--
3522	His lyre, to silence now consigned,
3096	His momentary loving glance
2507	His mother from the door doth scold.
3301	His mournful heart no peace could find,
1351	His name: the tenderness of home
1209	His neighbour's lowly tomb and mourned
 141	His own antagonists expert,
2496	His pony sniffing the fresh snows
4117	His recent glory he invokes.
4594	His relative and friend as well.
3124	His ruffian bravery adored,
2911	Hissed forth. With serious air indeed,
 432	His shop, a night-cap on his head,
  97	His son and mortgages his lands.
3353	His song, when still he slumbered deep,
4170	His son is married, just conceive!""And he--but of him presently--
2991	His soul by crash of music fired,
1998	His spirit sank with strange delight.
4877	His spirit was intent upon.
4944	His sunken eye and aspect faint,
2992	His tea with rum no more desired,
 851	His transports were quite maidenly,
4531	His travels like all other things
 767	His uncle, busy man indeed,
 153	His valet brings him letters three.
1619	His vanity first let us pique
3095	His visit she had not awaited,
2826	His wadded coat and cap with peak;
3234	His watch, the sun in turn he views--
3340	His weary head declined at rest,
4593	His wife approaches, with him leads
1112	His wife was also mad upon
  88	Homer, Theocritus, he jeered,
5029	Honour and pride inflexible.
3601	Hopeless are all the first, I own,
4236	Hopes, frolics, dreams and sentiment
 113	Hope to conceal and jealousy,
1458	Hope with her fascinating power
3994	Horror! had she not better stay
3517	Horror of sinfulness and shame,
 120	How artless was the note which spoke
 142	How bitterly he would malign,
 123	How bright and tender was his look,
1496	"How came you then to wed a man?"--
2429	How charming Olga's shoulders grow!
1296	How dark the night is getting though!
 122	How deftly could he transport feign!
  92	How empires store of wealth unfold,
1888	However cherries might abound,
1991	However, Tania's letter reading,
3033	However, the mazurka lacks
  93	How flourish, why and wherefore less
4577	How! from the waste of steppes unseen,"--
 119	How full of fire his speech would glow!
4792	How I have erred and felt the rod!
4904	How like a poet was my chum
 398	How like the billow I desired
3475	Howl like a dolt: 'tis meant for me!
5002	How mean, how pusillanimous!
4961	How meekly then I heard you preach--
4114	How much is in that word expressed!
1293	"How now, Oneguine, yawning still?"--
4404	How oft beneath the moonbeams pale
1213	"How often in thine arms I lay;
4401	How oft the kindly Muse away
4407	How oft to the Crimean shore
3122	How perfect doth our epoch grow!
2419	How pleasantly the evening jogs
 610	How sick to death his uncle lay
 112	How soon he learnt deception's art,
4708	How soon to habits she conformed
4384	How sweet a dream your memories raise!
4203	"How Tania grows! Doth it appear
3972	How the young imp on Tania doted!
4707	How thoroughly her part she took!
1515	How thy hands burn!"--"Dear nurse, I'm well.
1214	How with thy medal I would play,

3746	Hung on a pine branch earthward drawn

2456	Hymen's embarrassments, distress,
1932	I, after so much eloquence,
  27	I also wandered there of old,
3600	I am acquainted with fresh care,
1336	I am in love, my hour hath come!
1522	"I am in love, nurse! leave me now."
1516	I am--in love--you know--don't tell!"
1931	I am not strong enough to state;
2036	I am not worthy them in aught;
4359	I Apuleius gladly read
1643	I ask, all ye who poets are,
4973	I blame not your behaviour--
2286	I by the button-hole seize fast
1815	"I call to witness God on high--"
1634	I cannot help it I declare,
4828	I cannot longer wage concealed.
2423	I cannot tell on what pretence--
 750	I cannot tell the reason why,
1703	I cannot understand. But lo!
1641	I can't conceive a little dear
4548	I can't translate the adjective.
4345	"I celebrate a comrade young
3342	"Ideal," he had drowsy grown.
4872	Ideas, desires and woes confuse
4979	I did not please you. Why pursue
 808	Idolatry of liberty,
 395	I envied sore the billows tall,
 771	If but to lighten Time's dull rate,
2240	If cleverly or not I prate.But, O ye tomes without compare,
4807	I feel, allotted is my span;
1743	I feel thou wast by God sent down
4742	If his hot hand encountered hers,
2023	If in the scenes of home I might
1751	I flushed up, stupefied I grew,
3981	If not, the money I will lend."
2186	If Olga smilingly approve,
1032	I formerly admired her much
   2	If seriously he hath disease;
4995	If the choice in my power were,
2019	"If the domestic hearth could bless--
1717	If the fond hope I could have fanned
3273	If the poor maiden could have guessed
  94	If the raw product they possess

1734	I had found my predestinate,
 675	I have dreamed many a vision fair
 693	I have endured without respite.
3310	I have it. Lo! the very thing!
  99	I have no leisure here to dwell,
1748	I heard thy voice's resonance
4814	I hear your harsh, reproachful cry.
2099	I just hint, in parenthesis,
2931	I know not if his heart felt pain
1678	I know that Parny's tender pen
2149	I know there's none more amiable.But from the interview what flowed?
 353	I lift a warning voice because
 662	I like the difference to express
 575	I'll pass beneath the firmament,
1514	I'll sprinkle thee with holy water.--
3603	Illusions, dream, where, where your sweetness?
 246	I long by ballets have been bored,
3007	I long enough deceived have erred.
 354	I long have ceased to offend the laws.Alas! life's hours which swiftly fly
4965	I loved you--what did I obtain?
 358	I love its furious delight,
 388	I love them, O my dear Elvine,
5030	I love you--to what end deceive?--
2062	I love you with a brother's love,
3518	Imagination's sacred fires,
1774	Imagine! Here alone am I!
5026	I married--now, I supplicate--
2964	I'm beaten in another matter;
1820	I mean my name not to repeat."
3290	"I'm happy, say, is it not so?"--
 303	I might to connoisseurs repeat
1354	Immersed in melancholy thought,
 408	Immersed in secret thought I stand
2613	I'm not for witchcraft now inclined.
1697	I'm o'er it ever pondering.
 709	I mourn, but tears I cannot shed--
3218	Impatient, boiling o'er with wrath,
 222	Impatiently the gallery stamps,
4641	Impatient waits the close of day,
3661	Impelled by Spring's dissolving beams,
4618	Impelled by zeal for moral worth,

 547	Impressionable for an hour,
1701	Imprudent prattle of the heart,
3107	I murmur not! Why mournfulness?
3974	I mused: perhaps the matter's squared--
3612	I must resign myself, in sooth;
1826	In age the memory gets worse,
2596	In a half-open dressing-gown
2318	In aimless ease and far from strife,
3386	In a lax or informal way,
2263	In amorous flights when so inspired,
1106	In books he saw nought to condemn

3509	In bud of promise incomplete,
 460	In bullets, sabres, and in fight.His malady, whose cause I ween
1625	Incessantly his chains to break."I still a complication view,

2269	Incited by his stormy Muse
1853	In clouds of steam above perceive.
3715	In coach or post-cart duly placed
 430	In column blue the smoke doth rise;
4749	In company, or simply bowed,
3401	In consultation stand aside--
1638	In correspondence been allowed.
4925	Incorrigible rogue, doth go.
1725	In country solitude you mope,
3035	In country towns, where still it keeps
4063	In course of time (the whole extent

2538	In dreams and what the moon foretold
3540	In dressing-gown, a cuckold glad:
1169	In dressing-gown at meals appeared.

3539	Inhabited the country, clad
3643	In haunts of fashion where each day
1167	In her affairs ne'er interfered,
1153	In her friends' albums, time had been,
  18	Inheritor of all his race.
  78	In history he took no pleasure,
1396	In hopes of everlasting fame
2565	In horror for itself alone,
 659	In idleness and tranquil joy
3088	In jersey and in nightcap lay.
2459	In life domestic see a string
1956	In little maidens of thirteen?
1102	In love adventures she was versed,
2125	In love, although its tempests vex,
4735	In love-lorn meditation sad.
 975	In love's campaigns Oneguine heard
3537	In many things had changed his life--
2653	In melancholy loveliness,
3315	In mist profound all yet is hid.
1486	In monsters and fair dames was rich;
4028	In mother Winter's strange caprice.
1390	In motley and amusing chase.
3193	In much his conduct stigmatized;
3130	In mud and mire to wallow deep,
4078	Inns there are none. Pretentious but
4181	In old age life is weariness!"
2255	In Olga's album, youthful maid,
3089	In Olga's and Tattiana's rooms
1310	In Olga's face no life's displayed.
2737	In one great shout: she's mine! she's mine!"Mine!" cried Eugene with savage tone.
 763	In one he doth accounts behold,
1684	In one of thine enchanting lays
 101	In one thing really did excel.
2583	In order due the maidens pull;
1037	In pages of a love narration
4415	In poor Moldavia cast her lot,
3593	In rhyming I show laziness.
1636	In Russ her love made manifest,
2701	In scarlet cap revolving glides.
2501	In scarlet sash and sheepskin trim;
2508	In scenes like these it may be though,
4951	Insensible her hand remains
2467	In sensual sweets his soul doth steep
1140	Inseparable from our lot;
 903	Inseparable soon they be.
2789	Inseparable they remained.
5057	In serious mood or dalliance
2687	Inside clink glasses, cries resound
 219	In silence shall I sit and yawn
2660	In snow she sinks up to the knee;
 743	In solid, unpretentious style,
1972	In solitude or worldly din,
4524	In some a willing martyrdom.
2833	In spectacles and chestnut wig.
4532	Inspired but weariness intense;
1698	Inspired by whom this tenderness,
 496	Inspired him with disgust and so
 906	In spite of common sense we're wont
4362	In spring-time, heard the cygnet's note
 391	In springtime on the meadows green,
  39	Instructed jestingly the boy,
2233	In such an album with delight
2835	In Tania's praise in pouch he brought,
3942	Interrogation to denote.And my Tattiana now began
3649	In that morass where you and I
4223	In the beginning, cold and mute,
4616	In the beginning of this lay,
1083	In the broad meadow a gay rout,
3333	In the dawn of existence drear.
4261	In thee, thou world of empty bliss.In groups, official striplings glance
1270	In the first place, say, am I right?
  52	In the French language perfectly,
4254	In their sterility of prattle,
4960	In the lone garden and the lane?
4357	In the Lyceum's noiseless shade
1864	In the meantime her spirit sinks,
3379	In the meantime the mill inspects.
4637	In the recesses what hath stirred
4376	In the unfettered hours of leisure
4711	In the unmoved, magnificent
3635	In the world's mortal revelries,
5007	In the world's vortex my success,
 287	In this case quite mistaken was.
2451	In three weeks would arrive for them;
1463	In thy imagination warm,
3585	In time I'll give ye without fail
1828	In times gone by thy bare command--"
3868	Into accounts would sometimes look,
2177	Into delicious bondage gave
2917	Intoned it, manuscript in hand.
3345	Into the chamber where he slept
1854	Into the cups already sped
 797	Into the district then to boot
3856	Into the lonely house she went,
3712	Into the starry night extend.
4365	Into the study of the boy
3807	Into the tangled garden goes
4830	Into thy hands my fate I yield!No answer! He another sent.
3825	In tranquil flow. The beetle hums.
1664	Introduce verse in conversation.
2474	In true interpretation hates:
  63	In truth he had the happy trick
3314	In vain my anxious eyes appeal;
4495	In vain was youth by us received,
3714	In vehicles surcharged with freight;
3629	Invigorate imagination
3936	In what he merely acquiesced.
2167	In whispers low the neighbours said:
2361	In winter by its blank and dim
 390	In winter on the fender bright,
3864	In winter time would often come.
1094	In winter, when Night longer holds
3598	In worldly din or solitude
 969	In yarns of youthful troopers gay,
4284	In your young days and also mine),
 376	I once forgot for your sweet cause
3587	I on my chosen hero dote;
 720	I owe the censorship a little.
2401	I prefer sensible Bordeaux.
1676	I promised!--Did I so?--Well, there!
2291	I sail upon my lake at times
2027	I say without poetic phrase,
3422	Is cocked once more. Uneasy grown,
2041	I see you weep. Those tears of yours
 972	Is ever ready to proclaim
2408	Is ever ready with relief,
3286	Is ever thus. With frowning brow
2053	Is full of frigid jealousy,

4468	"Is he known to you?"--"Yes and No."Wherefore regarding him express
4455	"Is he the same or grown more wise?
1683	I should alarm our friendship tried:
4164	Is it a dream, and can it be?
4159	Is it for long?"--"Ma chere cousine!"
1644	Is it not true? the objects fair,
1753	Is it not truth? in tones suppressed
4472	Is it that ardent souls of flame
4470	Is it that human restlessness
4982	Is it that I am now compelled
 656	I slumber much, a little read,
1679	Is no more cherished amongst men.
2202	Is occupied with Olga fair,
4948	Is once again made manifest.
4986	Is petted by the Emperor?--
 179	Is seen next pine-apples of gold.
 986	Is still condemned in love to be;
2974	Is sweeter than thy Helen foul.No one the contrary will urge,
3779	Is the world to him sealed and dumb?
 227	Istomina the nimbly-bounding;
1793	Is waning. Yonder valley deep
4020	It blew: it howled: till winter e'en
1041	It carries of antiquity
 464	It gradually possessed his mind;
3615	I thank thee for thy joyfulness,
3619	I thank thee. In thy company,
4788	I then resolved my heart to tear;
1606	I the same admonition make.
4790	I thought--retirement, liberty,
2576	It matters not. Hope e'en to these
4778	It may be, I yield nutriment!
3527	It may be that his martyred shade
5022	It may be that I did proceed--
  25	It may be ye were born, or there
 461	It now to investigate is time,
 102	It occupied him from a boy,
4811	I tremble lest my humble prayer
3646	Its cold unfeeling sentences;
2500	Its driver seated on the rim
2391	Its ebullition foaming white
1236	Its insignificance I know
2774	Its name, my friends, was Martin Zadeka,
4507	Its passions and its modes of thought.The butt of scandal having been,
4414	Its splendour and its blandishments,
3036	Its stamping, capers and high leaps.
3554	Its waters to the neighbouring vale.
2013	It wakens in my breast again.
3178	It was a cheery, generous
 104	It whiled his idle hours away
2441	It will be by a mob beset
1450	I uttered to my lady fair
4215	Ivan Petrovitch still a gaby,
2097	I've had to make for having friends!But how? Quite so. Though I dismiss
 717	I've scanned it with a jealous eye,
 355	I've wasted in amusements vain,
1808	I was half silly with affright.
 520	I was incensed and he was sad.
4991	"I weep. And if within your breast
1439	I will descant on love's sweet dream,
3967	I will not wed, and ever weeps
3270	"I with my friend intend to fight!"If he had only known the wound
1263	"I won't detain you; but 'tis hard
2026	I would desire my bride to be--
2234	I would, my friends, inscriptions write,
4784	I would not part with finally;
 346	I would your vigilance arouse,
 704	I write, and anguish flies away,
4005	I yield for splendid vanities,
 722	I yield the fruit of work severe.
1688	I yield with a low reverence;
4142	Jackdaws on every spire--in scores.
2857	Jaws are at work. On every side
3248	Jealousy and vexation took
1980	Jilted--glad of a holiday.
2535	Journeys and warriors to wed.
2044	Judge then what roses would be ours,
4834	Just as he entered. How severe!
5040	Just at a moment which I grieve
 599	Just at that time his father died,
2421	Just at the hour we designate
3589	Just at this moment I cannot.
1197	Just before dinner-time he slept,
2497	Just manages a feeble trot
2718	Just placed the entrance door ajar.
2276	Just so! that modest swain is blest
2369	Keep your accounts! You'd rather not?
2481	Kept lingering on as loath to go,
1149	Kept the accounts, shaved many a crown,
4038	Kibitkas three, the accustomed train,
3498	Killed! at this dreadful exclamation
  86	Knew not an iamb from a choree,
2836	Known unto children perfectly:
4810	Know that thy face that day I see.
4993	Know that your sarcasm ill-suppressed,
1190	_Kvass_ needful was to them as air;
4549	Ladies in crowds around her close,
 109	Laid down his life of sun and storm
3751	Lament, embrace upon that grave.
4136	Lamp-posts, shops, sledges, families,
2205	Landscapes thereon he would design,
 371	Lapped in your Eastern luxury,
 438	Late in the afternoon to rise,
2812	Latest arrivals' salutations,
  70	Latin is just now not in vogue,
3090	Lay all the girls by sleep embraced,
 827	Lay languishing both day and night--
4428	Lead into good society,
3377	Leaning against the dam expects,
1640	Learn Russian, but the Lord defend!
2071	Learn to possess more self-control.
4057	Leisurely through the gateway glides.
 879	Lenski as a good match received,--
2185	Lenski at intervals would dare,
3181	Lenski his comrade did invite.
1219	Lenski his pencil-case took out
3246	Lenski, into confusion thrown,
3398	Lenski replied, and soon they be
3376	Lenski the foeman's apparition
3061	Lenski the stroke could not sustain,
4786	Lenski, unhappy victim, fell,
1847	Lenski unto the dame replied,

1623	Lest jaded with satiety,
 664	Lest the malicious reader or
4844	Lest the world or her lord divine
4344	Let me explain that in my song
  20	Let me present ye to the man,
3632	Let not the poet's spirit freeze,
4176	Let us go seek a little rest--
3730	Let us proceed unto a rill,
2571	Life lies extended, vast and bright,
2872	Lifts not her eyes which swimming fail.
4661	Light sallies without coxcombry,
4393	Like a Bacchante in her sport
4308	Like a full moon magnificent.
2834	Like a true Frenchman, couplets wrought
 670	Like Byron, bard of scorn and pride,
 231	Like down from Aeolus's lip,
3309	Like D when dinner doth inspire.Destiny hath preserved his lay.
 514	Like him renouncing vanity,
2390	Like Hippocrene it scatters light,
3161	Like Horace, planted cabbages,
4405	Like Leonora did she ride
4501	Like rotten leaves by Autumn strown--
3822	Like smoke athwart the heaven blue;
 299	Like Venus when, capriciously,
1221	Likewise an epitaph with tears
4464	Like you and me and all the rest?--
2064	Listen to me without disdain.
2164	Listless is she the livelong day
2600	List! the snow crunches--he draws nigh!
3160	Lived as a really wise man ought,
1772	Lo! at thy feet my tears I pour
4115	Lo! compassed by his grove of oaks,
 745	Lofty the chambers one and all,
4423	Lo! in my garden was she found
  47	Lo! my Oneguine free as air,
 629	Lo! my Oneguine rural lord!
1749	Long ago. Dream it cannot be!
1451	Long ago, prostrate at her feet.
4589	Long ago?"--"'Tis the second year."
3917	Long ceased to be a reading man,
1096	Longer the East inert reclines
3890	Long in this fashionable cell
4797	Long listen, comprehend the whole

3910	Longtime her tears flowed thick and fast;
1339	Long time her young imagination
3830	Long time in meditation deep
3578	Longtime was her heart desolate
2912	Long tortured by his lay divine,
4334	"Look quickly to your left, my sweet!"
4318	Looks upon all with absent gaze
 758	Look through the window and kill flies.
1794	Looms gray behind the mist and morn
 561	Lo! on the sleeping river borne,
3419	Lo! poured in a thin gray cascade,
3886	Lord Byron's portrait on the wall
 970	Lost in the hamlet far away.And in addition youth is flame
4674	Lo, the ambassador who speaks
2544	Lo! the prim cat upon the stove
2757	Lo! through the frozen windows play
3505	Loud paws the earth each panting horse,
3082	Loud snores the cumbrous Poustiakoff
3616	Love's tender transports and distress,
 674	Love to idealize inclined;
1556	Love to inspire doth woe appear
4309	Lo! with what pride celestial
4213	Luceria Lvovna paint applies,
4859	Madame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot:
2908	Made me so tipsy long ago!
3939	Made revelations undesigned,
 368	Madman, wilt thou from memory raze
 985	Mad spirit of the man who rhymes
4553	Maidens before her meekly move
2942	Maids in the corner whisper low;
3334	Maid whom my heart desires alone,
2440	Make up your mind to go there."--"Ah!
1366	Malek Adel and De Linar,
3211	Malicious and a slanderer.
3407	Malignant fury they disclose,
 756	Man--forty years long in this wise--

1428	May be that I by heaven's decrees
1999	May be the empire of the sense,
5059	May find a crumb to satisfy.
2010	May well in innocence impart.
 289	May yet be studious of his nails;

1879	Merciful God, what will he deem?"
3384	Method was dear unto his heart
2219	Metreless verses recognizing
2035	Me your perfections would not bless;

1295	More troublesome than usual?"--"No!

4112	Moscow! How much is in the phrase
4109	Moscow, how oft in evil days,
3652	Moscow, Russia's darling daughter,
4224	Moscow's young Graces at her stare,
 789	Most by this circumstance offended
3501	Most carefully Zaretski placed
 785	Most usually a Cossack horse
4686	Motionless, mute, tight-laced and trim.
4071	Mountains we'll level and through deep
3675	Mournful is thine approach to me,
4729	Mournful Love's deadly trace appears
1148	Mushrooms for winter salted down,
5041	Must be pronounced unfortunate--
2919	Must bow in common courtesy;
 527	Must e'en despise his kind at last;
1035	Must now my stanzas occupy.Tattiana was her appellation.
1933	Must take a walk and rest a bit--
2432	Must visit them. Come! you must own,
4691	Mute glances interchanged aside
2054	Mute, solemn, frowning gloomily.
3410	Mutual destruction to contrive.
 900	Mutual repulsion and ennui,
1806	My beauty, thou art ready too.
2682	"My chum lives here," Bruin grunts out.
 378	My country and an exile's lot;
1626	My country's honour and repute
1511	"My darling child, thou art in pain.--

1427	My friends, what means this odd digression?
2433	My friend, 'tis but to pay a debt,
3614	My frivolous and jolly youth.
 207	My goddesses, where are your shades?
1255	My gratitude do not disdain,
1744	My guardian angel to the grave.
2392	My heart of old would captivate.
1738	My heart's allegiance can resign,

4992	My image hath not disappeared,
 379	My joy in youth was fleeting e'en
1258	My light productions to retain,
5064	My little book. With thee I knew
5021	My lot is fixed--with thoughtlessness
 649	My lyre sings sweeter in the shade
3004	My memory wandered wide and sought
1807	My morning birdie, yesternight
1494	My mother-in-law who lately died
1245	My mournful fate in verse to weave,
2287	My neighbour, who by chance drew near,
3595	My pen no longer finds delight,
3093	My poor Tattiana cannot sleep
3758	My poor Vladimir, bitter tears
3772	My poor Vladimir! In the tomb,
3727	My pretty self-deceiving maid--
4902	My scholar without aptitude
3389	."My second!" cried in turn Eugene,
2061	My soul I cannot renovate--
4976	My soul is filled with gratitude!
3678	My spirit and my blood doth move,
 407	My spirit with such pangs before.Another time, so willed it Fate,
5008	My splendid house and gaieties--
4388	My sportive Muse I used to take
2541	Mysteriously all objects near
2020	My sum of happiness contained;
1453	My tongue is somewhat rusty now.Tattiana! sweet Tattiana, see!
   1	"My uncle's goodness is extreme,
1441	My unpretending page shall fill,
2144	My venerated reader, oh!
2236	My verses, kindly meant, would earn
 724	My very latest composition!
2987	My word of honour given have I.The tea, as I remarked, appeared,
2462	My wretched Lenski's fate I mourn,
4047	Nags eighteen to the door are driven.
4119	Napoleon tarried till it please
1758	Nay! even as this instant fled,
5020	Nay, near--but destiny decreed--
1867	Nearer they come--Eugene appears!
1056	Nearest and dearest knew not how
4145	Near Khariton's in a side street
3726	Near young Tattiana resident,
1065	Ne'er touched her fingers indolent
 957	Ne'er trusted to the treacherous ace.When, wise at length, we seek repose
2940	Neighbour by neighbour sat and snored,
3610	Never for me to reappear--
4285	Never upon my heroine
2438	Next Saturday. The Larina
1135	Night separated from her spouse,
4667	Noblesse and models of the mode,
4751	No coquetry was there, I vouch--
4793	No, ever to behold your face,
 530	No fond illusions live to soothe,
4124	No gift she bears, no feast proclaims,
2275	No greater pleasure can exist
3786	No longer through her former home;
4336	"No matter, look immediately.
1275	"No misery I see in that"--
2340	No more at dawn the shepherd will
3819	No more remembered him; unto
 333	No more the music thunders loud,
3728	No more the village knows his face,
 543	No more with pale Diana's rays,
 691	None, be my witness Heaven above!
4559	None could a trace of that impute,
4557	None could her beautiful declare,
4572	None the conviction could withstand
 400	No, never in the early blaze
4968	No novelty--is it not true?--
2193	(Nonsense and pure absurdity,
3392	No obstacle of which I know.
2636	No one appeared to lend a hand.
1775	No one my anguish comprehends,
 768	No other book had time to read.
1372	No other than Oneguine mine.
4864	Nor almanacs nor newspapers,
2342	Nor at the hour of noon with sound
4248	Nor aught confides unto the rest.Tattiana would have gladly heard
 993	Nor beauties of far distant lands
 470	Nor boston nor the world's affairs
1050	Nor by her beauty she became
1049	Nor by her sister's brilliancy
2771	Nor Byron, Walter Scott, nor Seneca,
2669	Nor dares the skirting of her dress
1914	Nor did her blushes fade away,
4912	Nor died nor lost his senses quite.
2152	Nor discontinued to distress
 705	Nor doth my absent pen portray
3259	Nor enough strength of mind possessed
3809	Nor even tears afford respite,
2257	Nor frigid adulation paid.
4486	Nor from the mob polite estranged,
1316	Nor further comment that night made.
 992	Nor homage which the Muse demands
2455	Nor in his dreams anticipates
2165	Nor interest in aught betrays.
 449	Nor long his mind was agitated
2317	Nor marked how summer's prime had fled
1800	Nor on the letter yet hath she
2769	Nor precepts sage nor pictures e'en,
1435	Nor shall my pen paint terribly
3267	Nor shall the bud of yesterday
3265	Nor shall the caterpillar come
 456	Nor slander viciously could spread
 874	Nor sparkled with poetic fire,
 994	Nor study, banquet, rout nor ball
4602	Nor sudden turned she red or white,
 471	Nor tender glance nor amorous sigh
4032	Nor the first snow of winter seize
4031	Nor the frost particles inhale
2772	Nor the _Journal des Modes_, I vouch,
3761	Nor true unto her sorrow kept.
 875	Nor wit, nor did the same inspire
 991	Nor years of separation all
4604	Nor yet her lip compressed did bite.
4089	No senseless fashionable lay
4256	No sense was ever manifest
4599	No signs of trouble her accused,
1104	Not a bad fellow was her father
3444	Not agony, but death expressed.
2072	Not all will like myself proceed--
3203	Not a mere hot, pugnacious boy,
2876	Not, and a flood of bitter tears
1268	"Not at all."--"That I can't conceive!
3205	Not bristled up like a wild beast,
1871	Not daring to cast back her eyes.
3608	Not even a poetic phrase,
4565	Not high in general estimation;
1836	"Nothing, good nurse, there's nothing wrong,
2667	No time to pick it up! afraid,
2443	"Not in the least, assured am I!"--
2791	Not knowing its interpretation,
4179	Not only sorrow--Ah! my dear,
 372	No trace ye left in passing by
1942	Not seeking love but sensual sweets.
4122	Not so! My Moscow never went
1114	Not that she had his works perused,
4606	Not the least trace Oneguine sees
4695	Not the young timid maid, believe,
4466	Not to behave as he did once--
4503	Nought but of dinners a long row,
 497	Nought from his pen did ever flow,
4863	Nought in the universe refused:
3034	Nought of its charms original
2333	November at the gate did stand.The morn arises foggy, cold,
1349	Now all things round about repeat
2661	Now a long branch itself entwined
3463	Now, as in a deserted house,
2829	Now buffoon, glutton, and a bore.
 247	Now Didelot scarce can be endured!"Snakes, satyrs, loves with many a shout
1833	Now don't be cross with me, my soul,
4427	Now for the first time I my Muse
3222	Now for the jealous youth what joy!
3284	Now gloomy seemed and cheerful now,
 232	Now her lithe form she arches o'er
4180	Now I am fit for nothing here.
1677	Now I am ready to refuse.
1545	Now it is ready to be sent--
3406	Now, like hereditary foes,
3118	Now of a family the head,
 578	Now talkative, now reticent;
2664	Now the sweet little shoes she wore,
5060	Now we must separate. Good-bye!
1359	Now with what eager interest
1536	"Nurse, leave me. I would be alone.
2816	Nurses who scream and babes who bleat.
4230	Obedient then to Nature's law,
 224	Obedient to the magic strings,
1338	Obedient to warm Spring's commands.
1578	Obeyed the impulses of heart?--
5066	Oblivion of life's tempest dire,
 568	O Brenta, once more we shall meet
 117	Obsequious or indifferent!
2270	Odes Lenski also had outpoured,
4347	O epic Muse, my powers increase
2347	O'er all a sheet of silvery dust
4024	O'er hillock and o'er meadow throws.
3330	O'er my remains to drop a tear,
2492	O'erspread with Winter's carpet bright,
2808	O'erwhelmed with guests; by families
4544	Of affectation innocent,
 591	Of Africa, ancestral land,
4638	Of a heart cold and cynical?
2895	Of all the guests within his mind.Certainly not Eugene alone
2801	Of a most mournful episode,
3702	Of a strange night when the moon and--
2310	Of a young dark-eyed country maid,
2990	Of bassoons and of flutes the strain.
2082	Of censure for the same incurred;
1185	Of Christmas carols, song and dance;
4107	Of churches, gardens, belfries high
2331	Of clamorous geese flew southward bound.
2603	Of clarinet or flute doth cry:
4547	Of "comme il faut." Shishkoff, forgive!
3810	Of consolation all bereft--
3648	Of conversation, thought and aims--
1331	Of course Tattiana was annoyed
 601	Of creditors a hungry rout
4432	Of diplomats and warlike beaux
 754	Of drawing-rooms or old or new.
 592	Of dreary Russia left behind,
3006	O feet, where'er your path extends
1966	Of error and the passions' strife.
2442	Of every sort and every set!"--
3582	Of fashionable dames the foe,
 401	Of fiery youth's untutored days
 657	Of fleeting glory take no heed.
3953	Of foreign whims the impersonation--
2731	Of frantic laughter, and all eyes
5067	Of friends the grateful intercourse--
1172	Of friends unceremonious would
1235	Of frivolous existence, friends;

3706	Of Levshin's school ye followers,
3320	Of life or death predestinate.
4561	Of London life is "vulgar" called
 121	Of love again, and yet again;
 580	Of love which whilom Petrarch sung.
 686	Of maids dost thou inscribe thy song?
 772	Of many an economic scheme;
4417	Of migratory gipsy hordes--
 630	Of mines and meadows, woods and lakes,
3039	Of modern Russians the disease.Bouyanoff, wrathful cousin mine,
1686	Of my impassioned heroine.
4398	Of my light paramour was proud.
2844	Of old maids the divinity,
2259	Of Olga he in song averred;
1723	Of one thing till again we met.
5052	Of passion reminiscences,
 418	Of passion they so often raise.
2460	Of pictures painful harrowing,
3878	Of priceless value all things seem

2793	Of such a dread hallucination.

4894	Of thankless friends the circle rose,
  77	Of the AEneid, but incorrect.
 183	Of the commencement of the piece.
5085	Of the cup brimming o'er with wine--
 187	Of the domains of the side-scene.
1314	Of the horizon she is like!"--
4699	Of the imperial Neva's shore.
 856	Of the moon in the tranquil skies,
 558	Of the night sentinels arise
1374	Of the romances she preferred,
4920	Of the sun glisten; muddy, worn,
4607	Of the Tattiana of times fled.
 280	Of thirty different sorts, lo! brushes
3621	Of thy delights I drank my fill,
  65	Of touching lightly every theme.
1060	Oft staring through the window pane
 683	Oft upon friendly lips doth rise:
 385	Of untold gain she must conceal,
3562	Of Volga fishermen doth sing,
3940	Of what he thought and what believed,
 859	Of what not, and of distant dim,
3692	Of which the rustling woods remind?
1184	Of whirligigs were very fond,
2387	Of widow Clicquot or Moet
3753	Of woe: effaced the pathway now:
4526	Of woods and fields the calm retreat,
4798	Of your perfections in my soul,
3513	Of youthful impulse, reverie,
2478	'Oh, do not dream these fearful dreams,
4838	Oh, how her lips compressed restrain
4209	"Oh! how our years are vanishing!"But nothing changed in them is seen,
4634	Oh! I accept. And instantly
4167	"Oh! I remember, where is he?"--
5068	Oh, many a year hath run its course
1829	"Oh! nurse, nurse, you don't understand!
1224	Oh! on the fields of life how bloom

4899	Oh! what had been his eminence!
3311	"Oh! whither have ye winged your way,

3071	Olga began to long likewise
3302	Olga he sees before his eyes
3242	Olga ran skipping from the door.
1841	Olga's admirer came that day:
1177	Olga the tea must supervise--
3238	Olga with trepidation dire.
3963	"Olinka is her junior, see.
2946	Ombre, and whist all others worth:
4700	O Men, how very like ye are
2540	Omens inspired her soul with fear,
2479	O my Svetlana.'--Joukovski
 342	On balls I madly used to dote,
2980	Once more, when she appeared in sight,
3086	On chairs in the saloon reposed,
2086	Oneguine acted very well
5005	"Oneguine, all this sumptuousness,
3068	Oneguine, bored to death again,
3182	Oneguine, by first impulse moved,
2884	Oneguine could not now submit,
3440	Oneguine fired--Alas! alas!
4958	Oneguine, hast forgotten yet
3380	Oneguine his excuses says;
4963	"Oneguine, I was younger then,
  72	Oneguine knew enough, the rogue
2722	Oneguine lightning glances shot;
 555	Oneguine meditative stood,
4911	Oneguine ne'er as poet showed
3042	Oneguine Olga bore away.
  23	Oneguine, O my gentle readers,
 762	Oneguine oped the cupboards wide.
2710	Oneguine sat the table by
4753	Oneguine's cheek grew ashy pale,
1832	Oneguine's letter!"--"Ah! the thing!
3434	Oneguine slowly then began
3938	Oneguine's pencillings. His mind
 535	Oneguine's speeches I abhorred
4514	Oneguine--take him up again--
5014	Oneguine--the beloved place
2006	Oneguine then approached and said:
3176	Oneguine to the window went
3348	Oneguine waits on us, 'tis like."
 186	Oneguine was a citizen
  61	Oneguine was--so many deemed,
4755	Oneguine wasted; on my word,
3935	Oneguine was the most impressed,
3499	Oneguine went with trepidation
 987	One image occupied his mind,
 911	One instrument for his own use--
4077	One moment's slumber suffer not.
 152	One morn whilst yet in bed he lay,
3877	On everything around her gaze,
1567	On fresh allurements they are bent,
1191	On guests their servants used to wait
 645	On him spleen mounted sentinel
 902	On horseback every day they ride--
2363	On horseback gallop o'er the steppe!
 651	On innocent delights I dote,
4069	On iron bridges we shall gaze
1329	On Lenski's matrimonial fate
4875	On lines invisible are fixt;
3793	Only her countenance assumed
2579	On melted wax in water poured;
 221	On pit, stalls, boxes, brightly blaze,
1382	On raptures, sorrows not her own,
4633	On such a day. O Heavens, 'tis she!
3871	On Sundays by yon window he,
2526	On sunny days the glistening rime,
4919	On the blue blocks of ice the rays
 215	On the dull stage find all things changed,
4111	On thee I used to meditate!
 110	On the steppes of Moldavia lone,
3231	On thigh or temple, friend on friend.Resolved the flirt to cast away,
1187	On Trinity Sunday yawned at prayer,
 237	On unknown female forms he throws.
3781	On us beyond the grave attends,
 587	On waves by tempests curdled o'er!
3803	On whom a sister's heart was set
2321	On winters of the south a skit,
1195	Opened the portals of the tomb
1803	Opened with care, and entering bore
3140	Openly or 'neath decent cloak.
3855	Opens unto her visitor.
1480	Open the window--sit by me."
4178	Oppressive now is happiness,
2820	Oppressor of the wretched poor;
2285	Or, after dinner's dull repast,
4463	Or a good fellow for the nonce,
3484	Or any trifle else ye like
1656	Or a professor in tulle cap.
1706	Or, as it were, the Freischutz' score
2559	Or a swift hare from mead to mead
2551	Or a swift meteor, may be,
1654	Or at a promenade mayhap,
 647	Or better,--like a faithful wife.I was for calm existence made,
3776	Or, beyond Lethe lulled to rest,
1673	Or Bogdanovitch's sweet lays.
 405	Or bosom full of languid fire,--
3521	Or but for fame he saw the light;
2120	Or by a card our homage pay,
 393	Or by the ocean's rocky shore.
 607	Or counting on his uncle's death
1398	Or couplets more ingenious still;
3579	Or did her tears soon cease to flow?
2971	Or e'en Istomina, my dear,
4513	Or e'en the "Demon" of my strain.
2289	Or else ,
3486	Or even overcome by wrath
1596	Or even, silent and resigned,
5055	Or faults of grammar on its page--
5016	Or for the solitary tomb
4743	Or he dispersed the motley crowd
3689	Or, heedless of the leaves' return
 897	Or ice and flame, are not diverse
4908	Or "Idol mio," and in the grate
2932	Or if he meant to flirt again,
 518	Original imagination,
5058	Or in a squabble to engage,
3318	Or innocently past me fly.
1594	Or into bold hands anxiously
3697	Or, it may be, we inly seek,
2188	Or kiss the border of her dress.To Olga frequently he would
4883	Or letters of a maiden young.And by degrees upon him grew
1421	Or Melmoth, gloomy wanderer he,
4512	Or monster of Satanic pride,
4462	Or other mask donned playfully?
2469	Or, parable more flattering,
3955	Or parody of modern ways?Hath she found out the riddle yet?
2410	Or quietly partake our woe.
4750	Or recognized not in the crowd.
3151	Or reconciled them, it may be,
3683	Or, strange to me is happiness?
4451	Or suffering pride? Why is he there?
1115	Or that adoring Grandison
 344	Or the delivery of a note.
1423	Or the mysterious Sbogar.
1780	Or to disturb my dreams approach
4745	Or to pick up her kerchief stooped.She seemed of him oblivious,
1765	Or torturer malevolent?
 446	Or vainly 'mid luxurious fare
3693	Or, when anew all Nature teems,
 214	Or will my melancholy glance
2207	Or, with a pen and colours fit,
3676	O Spring, thou chosen time of love!
3596	Other and colder thoughts affright,
4383	O triumphs of my guileless days,
4075	Our bridges long neglected rot,
4211	Our dear old aunt, Princess Helene,
1945	Our fathers used to dote upon;
4419	Our godlike tongue she could exchange
1290	Our heroes at full gallop sped,
3216	Our idol, Honour's motive force,
2126	Our liberty at least survives:
2886	Our misanthrope was full of ire,
4706	Our paradise is no more sweet.Ah! how Tattiana was transformed,
4066	Our roads transformed the eye will strike;
 908	Ourselves as unities to count;
1370	Our tender dreamer had enrolled
2038	Our union would produce but grief.
3897	Our youthful wanderer should roam.
4227	Outlandish and provincial,
2418	Outside descend the mists of night.
3975	O yes! my hopes soon disappeared."
2765	Page after page continued reading,
3016	Pair after pair the race sustain.
1839	Pale as a ghost and dressed since morn
1996	Pallid and melancholy face,
4932	Pallid and with dishevelled hair,
 310	Pardon I ask for such a sin--
2981	Paris and Menelaus right.
2486	Park, garden, palings, yard below
3773	Passed into dull eternity,
2645	Passes the torrent But alack!
4385	Passion's wild sway I then allowed,
 319	Past darkened windows and long streets
4135	Past palaces and nunneries,
4134	Past women, sentry-boxes, rolls,
  62	Pedantic although scholar like,
4217	Pelagie Nikolavna has
1537	Pen, paper bring: the table too
3253	Perceived that he was still beloved,
 159	Perchance he will to all the three.
2063	Perchance one more affectionate.
 699	Perchance they laurels also cull--
1558	Perchance upon the Neva e'en
 886	Perchance where Dunia pours out tea
1608	Perchance you also soon may burn,
2700	Perched on a goose's neck a skull
1250	Perish absorbed by Lethe's stream.
3268	Perish when half disclosed its bloom!"--
2112	Permit me; is it worth the trouble
 613	Perused, Eugene in postchaise went
4857	Perusing Gibbon and Rousseau,
3167	Pervaded with much common sense.
4469	Perverse, unfavourable views?
3970	Petoushkoff met the selfsame doom.
2824	Petoushkoff, the provincial swell;
4130	Petrovski Palace; come, astir!
4116	Petrovski Palace! Gloomily
 277	Phials of crystal scents enclose.
4460	Philanthropist or patriot,
 274	Philosopher just turned eighteen.China and bronze the tables weight,
5053	Pictures of the amusing scene,
4685	Pink as Palm Sunday cherubim,
3479	Placed at the customary range;
2503	Placed in a sledge his terrier black,
2858	Plates, knives and forks are clattering
3865	Please follow this way, lady mine,
4442	Please her by their decorum fixed,
3548	Poetical enthusiast,
1010	Poetic transport did infuse,
 695	Poetic transport. They impart
1072	Polite demeanour to preserve,
4892	Poltroons and men of slanderous tongue,
1212	"Poor Yorick," mournfully he said,
4041	Portmanteaus and preserves in jars,
3923	Portrayed contemporary man
 262	Portray the solitary den
1632	Possessed nor ease nor fluency,
4702	Possession hath no power to please,
 573	Possess my love and sympathy.
 837	Pour on this orb a dazzling light
4453	Pray is it he? It is the same.
1266	Pray is it not a tough affair
2543	Presentiments oppressed her heart.
1286	Present me."--"You are joking."--"No."--
2249	Presents her quarto amiably,
1273	Preserves and an eternal prattle
2880	Prevailed at last. She in reply
3707	Priams of country populations
3832	Proceeds, until she from a hill
4477	Professions eagerly for deeds,
 327	Profiles of lovely dames he knows
4881	Prophecies, threats and apparitions,
 151	Proud of his dinners and his wife!
1769	Providence otherwise may deem--
1573	Pursues phantasmagoria vain.Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed?--
4387	Pursuits I followed of the crowd,
3149	Quarrels among young friends he bred
2223	_Qu'ecrirer-vouz sur ces tablettes?_
4255	Questions and news and tittle-tattle,
3713	Quick to the country let us wend
1319	Quite a sensation; the position
2108	Quite inadvertently meanwhile;
5036	Raged round him and of balked desire!
1668	Raises within my breast as oft
2797	Raven, snowstorm, tempest, fog,
2348	(Readers expect the rhyme of _rose_,
5047	Reader, whoever thou mayst be,
1979	Rebuffed--as quickly reassured,
4747	Received him freely at her house,
1074	Recent instructions of its mother.But Tania ne'er displayed a passion
 963	Reduced with effort unto sense,

2000	Regained authority awhile,

4832	Remained unnoticed. Once he went
2740	Remained with him the youthful maid.
3784	Remains on earth the unseemly rage,
3914	Remarkable. She then indeed
1132	Removed her to his country seat,
4678	Renowned for his acumen, wit,
1670	Repentance wields not now her spell
3298	Replaced them in their box, undressed
2066	Replace the visions fancy drew;
5054	Repose from labour, satire keen,
4187	Repose her silken curtains fled,
3743	Repose in peace, thou child of song_."
1247	Rescue me from oblivion.Perchance some heart 'twill agitate,
4540	Reserved, but not inanimate,
3523	Resounding through all ages might
1478	Restless Tattiana sleepless lay
4782	Restrained the impulses of youth;
 677	Retained the image, though short-lived,
4533	Returning, from his ship amid
2837	_Reveillez-vouz, belle endormie_.
 239	Reviews both dress and countenance,
2582	Rings from a dish of water full
1960	Rings, tears, deceptions and intrigues,
2828	Rogue and extortioner of yore,
1030	Romance of love I pray refer,
3922	Romances three, in which ye scan
2633	Rooted unto the spot remained.As if against obstruction sore
3217	Round which revolves the universe.
1103	Rousseau and Richardson to boot.
 282	Rousseau, I would remark in passing,
1935	Rural LifeCanto The FourthThe less we love a lady fair
 212	Russia's Terpsichore review
2881	Said something in an undertone
2594	Sailed silently in unison--
1475	Sails her allotted course on high,
4681	Saint Priest, who every album's page
4368	Sang childhood's pastimes and its joy,
 202	Sarcastic Shakhovskoi brought out
2136	Satan will jest, and at love's cost.Oh! where bestow our love? Whom trust?
4040	Saucepans and mattresses and chairs,
1303	"Say, of the two which was Tattiana?"
3026	Scarce credits what his eyes can see.Hark! the mazurka. In times past,
1750	Scarce hadst thou entered thee I knew,
 362	Scarcely in Russia can ye find
1983	Scarce mindful of their love and guile.
4650	Scarce to her questions he responds,
1928	Scarlet as burnt by inward flame.
 279	Scissors both straight and curved as well,
3487	Scornfully challenged you afield--
 236	Seated, a curious look with glasses
2518	Secret excursions made in sleighs;
3682	Secure in rural quietude--
3155	_Sed alia tempora_. And bravery
2404	Seductive, animated, bright,
2907	Seductive cup of love, whose flow
4174	See, I can hardly crawl about--
 606	Seeing in this no deprivation,
3732	Seeks, winding amid meadows still,
4580	Seek the forgotten countenance
3669	Seemed in a haze of green embowered.
 962	Seems so unnatural and absurd:
3049	Seen all, beside himself with wrath,
3833	Sees where a noble mansion stood,
4474	Selfish nonentities around?
1951	Serious endeavours to assure
1205	Servant of God and brigadier,
1400	Serve who could neither read nor write.Time was, in style magniloquent
4100	Seven days and nights the travellers plod.
2166	Shaking with serious air the head,
1429	Shall abdicate the bard's profession,
4060	Shall I behold thee once again?"--
3838	"Shall I proceed, or homeward flee?
 211	Shall I your chorus hear anew,
1434	Shall my declining years beguile;
 836	Shall surely, be it soon or late,
3397	"Shall we commence?"--"Let it be so,"
1849	Shamefaced, Tattiana downward looked
2735	Sharp rows of tushes, bony claws,
3769	She bows her head beneath the crown;
4392	She brought with her the gift of song.
4247	She buries deep within her breast
4653	She calm and unconcerned appears.The husband comes and interferes
2675	She cannot draw a breath or stir.
2728	She cannot--Eugene oped the door
2726	She cannot--then impatiently
4946	She comprehends. The simple maid
2788	She consolation thence obtained--
4188	She could not sleep in her new bed.
2581	She deemed its outline might afford.
1616	She did not think "procrastination
2621	She dreamt she journeyed o'er a field
1362	She drinks in those seductive deeds!
3844	She enters a deserted yard--
1872	She fears and like an arrow rushes
3053	She fears she cannot.--Cannot? Why?--
3909	She found herself alone at last,
1920	She from the winter corn espies
3858	She gazed--a cue, forgotten long,
2756	She gazed around her--it was day.
3836	She gazed thereon, and instant beat
2783	She got a book of nursery tales,
1884	She heard of servant-maids the note,
1355	She hears of conversation nought
2668	She hears the bear behind her press,
1381	She heaves a sigh and deep intent
3898	She hid the trouble of her breast,
2431	She is an angel! We sometime
4408	She led me through nocturnal mist
3574	She leisurely away doth ride,
4716	She mourned and to the moon would raise
1383	She murmurs in an undertone
3577	She muses: "What was Olga's fate?
1077	She ne'er repeated unto hers.
2642	She nerves herself from her alarm
3815	She never more his face may view,
1575	She never of deception dreamed
4598	She on the apparition gazed,
1346	She oped her eyes and cried: 'tis he!
2690	She peeped through a chink of the door.
3054	She promised Eugene, or she would
5033	She rose--departed. But Eugene
2671	She runs, the bear upon her trail,
1467	She seeks the garden in her need--
4896	She sits alone--'tis ever _she!_So frequently his mind would stray
1163	She soon forgot, began to call
4941	She starts, nor doth a word express,
2727	She strains her throat to force a cry--
1134	She struggled hard at first thus pent,
2870	She, than the morning moon more pale,
4012	She the acquaintances she loves,
1360	She the delicious novel reads,
2550	She trembled and grew deadly pale.
4416	She visited the humble tents
1344	She waited for--I don't know whom!
1882	She waits, on fire her trembling frame--
3806	She wanders aimless as a sprite,
3243	She was as heedless and as gay--
1304	"She who with melancholy face
4835	She will not see, she will not hear.
1157	She wore her corset tightly bound,
1159	She would pronounce _a la Francaise_;
 884	Shifts, tacks about, until they prate
4307	Shines in the female firmament
 194	Shone pungent Satire's dauntless king,
2132	Should be respected throughout life
 357	Should dearly like a dance again.
3977	Should go, the market for a maid,
3009	Should make me much more circumspect,
3213	Should recompense his idle jeers,
2814	Shouts, laughter, jamming 'gainst the wall,
 234	Shouts of applause! Oneguine passes
1851	Shrill sang the _samovar_ at eve,
1052	Shy, silent did the maid appear
4764	Sickness more courage doth command
1122	Sighs on another than her lord
  66	Silent, oracular ye'd see him
 746	Silk tapestry upon the wall,
1795	Silvers the brook; the shepherd's horn
4216	Simeon Petrovitch just as shabby;
1559	Similar dames ye may have seen.
3119	Simple and kindly and unwed,
2268	Since Fame and Freedom he adored,
5069	Since I beheld Eugene and young
4205	Since in these arms I thee did bear--
3404	Since leisure was together spent,
3200	Sincerely loving him, Eugene
 307	Since words like pantaloons, vest, coat,
2264	Singing God knows what maid admired,
1886	Singing in chorus all the while.
2344	Singing inside her hut the maid
4160	"Sit down. How funny, to be sure!
2692	Sit many monstrous shapes abhorred.
4649	Sits by her gloomily, desponds,
4434	Sits down and gazes on all sides--
2527	Sledging, the snows, which at the time
 437	Sleep in the shadowy couch enjoys,
3894	Slept o'er the river misty grown.
 229	Slow circling round its fellow swings
1970	Slowly exhausted by desire,
3358	Slumber still o'er him lingering flies.
2338	Snorts, and his rider bends his course
 967	So ancient warriors, battles o'er,
 402	So ardently did I desire
4827	So be it! But internal strife
3316	So be it! Just the laws which bid
4752	Society endures not such!
4467	Society he duped enow."
4850	Society renounced once more.
3445	So from the mountain lazily
 482	So full of piety, correct,
 345	So hearken, every worthy spouse,
 485	So inaccessible to men,
1586	So irremissible appear?O ye whom tender love hath pained
 316	So let us to the ball-room haste,
1823	So many neighbours here exist--
 115	Sombre or glad in turn to be,
 334	Some a mazurka occupies,
 928	So meantime let him joyous live
5078	Some are afar and some are dead.
2231	Some army poet therein may
1934	Some day I'll somehow finish it.
1252	Some future ignoramus shall
3045	Some madrigal not worth a rush,
4672	Some marriageable maids behold,
2189	Some nice instructive novel read,
 665	Some one or other editor
3699	Some other long-departed Spring,
4862	Some Russian authors he perused--
2266	Sometime collected, shall relate
 127	Sometimes by pleasing flattery's art,
 128	Sometimes by ready-made despair;
2305	Some wretched journal in his hand;
1890	So mouths they stopt with song, not fruit--
 710	Soon, of the tempest which hath fled
3021	Soon the maid on a chair he seats,
 483	So prudent, and so circumspect
 617	Sorrow to counterfeit and wail--
2614	So she her silken sash unlaced,
1633	So she in French herself expressed.
4098	So Tania to her heart's content
2850	So there will be a dance to-night.
4283	(So 'twas with us in former years,
 589	So uncongenial to my mind,
2307	Sound sleep, books, walking, were his bliss,
3170	So, when he came next day to call,
2630	Spanned the unbridled torrent o'er;
2091	Spared him not their asperities.
2146	Spare yourself unavailing pain
3872	Spectacles upon nose, all day
4252	Speech was so tame and colourless
2345	Spins, whilst the friend of wintry night,
3575	Spite of herself with Lenski's lot
3638	Spoiled children most degenerate
4913	Spring cheered him up, and he resigned
3735	Spring's paramour, pours forth her song
3709	Spring summons you to her green bowers,
 336	Spurs of the Cavalier Guard clash,
4232	Squeeze tiny hands and osculate;
 484	Stately, devoid of prejudice,
3597	Sterner solicitudes engage,
4688	Stiff, overstarched and insolent,
3918	Still certain authors, I may add,
4456	Still doth the misanthrope appear?
4222	Still eats and drinks enough for twain.Their daughters kiss Tattiana fair.
 253	Still everywhere, without, within,
4356	Still for ever fare thee well.'--Byron
 951	Still happier he who ne'er hath known!
4763	Still hopes, endeavours, though in vain.
4220	Still of his club he member was--
 818	Still sovereigns of his spirit were,
 251	Still the loud stamping doth not cease,
 252	Still they blow noses, cough, and sneeze,
 180	Still thirst fresh draughts of wine compels
1055	Stood as estranged from all aloof,
5034	Stood as if struck by lightning fire.
3567	Stops at the tomb in passing by;
2684	Straight for the entrance then he made
 421	Straight from the ball to bed he goes,
4611	Straight from their province had he come?"--
1078	Strange unto her each childish game,
4072	Streams excavate subaqueous ways,
1181	Strictly the Carnival observed,
1548	Striking the intellect with awe
2752	Struck Lenski dead--across the scene
1707	Strummed by a timid schoolgirl o'er.I write to you! Is more required?
3344	Subdued him, when his neighbour stept
2674	Submissive as if in a swoon,
2224	Subscribed, _toujours a vous, Annette;_
4271	Successfully to please her tried,
2055	Such am I. This did ye expect,
 880	Such is the country custom good;
2002	Such open-hearted innocence.
2315	Such was Oneguine's sainted life,
1963	Such were the musings of Eugene.
2549	Suddenly to the left hand side,
1468	Sudden she stops, casts down her eyes
 882	Suitable for this semi-Russian.
3998	Surveying them, she thus doth say:
2891	Swearing how Lenski he would rile,
1025	Sweet as the kiss of lovers sworn.
3474	Sweeter it is, my friends, if he
2156	Sweet slumber winged its way and fled.
3470	Sweet to behold him obstinate,
2805	Swift following in her wake, the sun,"
2733	Tails which a bushy tuft adorns,
2294	Take to their wings and fly away.But to Oneguine! _A propos!_
2904	Tall, slender, like thy form designed,
1858	Tania doth by the casement linger
4162	"Tania, my eldest child, you know"--
4317	Tania, observed by nobody,
2792	Tania the meaning would obtain
2915	Tania well nigh expired when he
2606	Tattiana
3891	Tattiana as enchanted stood;
3851	Tattiana asks, and hurriedly
1845	Tattiana blushed, her heart beat quick--
4270	Tattiana by a poor aunt's side,
2546	Tattiana certainly infers
2716	Tattiana courage doth regain
2074	Tattiana, dim with tears her eyes,
2078	Tattiana doth accept his aid;
2786	Tattiana every day conferred
1927	Tattiana faltered, and became
4645	Tattiana finds in loneliness.
3841	Tattiana from the hill descends
2578	Tattiana gazed with curious eye
1534	Tattiana gazes on the moon,
3798	Tattiana gently led them there.And long her eyes as through a haze
5070	Tattiana in a misty dream,
2632	Tattiana in despair unfeigned
2595	Tattiana in the yard appears
4938	Tattiana in the young princess!
2536	Tattiana in traditions old
3986	Tattiana learns the intelligence--
4733	Tattiana loved as when a lad,
2154	Tattiana more than ever burned
2750	Tattiana motionless abides.The strife grew furious and Eugene
2634	Tattiana o'er the stream complained;
2779	Tattiana purchased with a stray
2522	Tattiana, Russian to the core,
2425	Tattiana, saucy Olga thine?"--
3933	Tattiana saw with trepidation
1525	Tattiana's beauty, pale with care,
1694	Tattiana's letter I possess,
1613	Tattiana's love was quite sincere,
2896	Tattiana's trouble might have spied,
3281	Tattiana suffered secretly;
4061	Tattiana tears cannot restrain.The limits of enlightenment
2755	Tattiana terrified awoke.
2923	Tattiana thanks to all returned,
1376	Tattiana through the forest erred,
4761	Tattiana--thus the sex is born.--
2742	Tattiana to a corner, bids
2794	Tattiana to the index flies
1840	Tattiana waits. No answer came!
1910	Tattiana with impatience waited
2725	Tattiana would attempt to fly,
1513	Tell me at once what wilt thou have?
3488	Tell me, of sentiments concealed
1842	"Tell me, why doth your comrade stay?"
3514	Tender and elevated, free?
2042	Tend not my heart to mitigate,
4281	Terpsichore alone among
1081	Terrible tales she loved to hear.
4390	Terror of guardians of the night;
2969	Than cold Oneguine's oddities,
4765	Than health, so with a trembling hand
 673	Than one's own fascinating self.Here I remark all poets are
 831	That a friend's arm in every case
2238	That afterwards with evil smile
 193	That all may hear his voice's tone.Thou fairy-land! Where formerly
1301	That bilberry wine, I'm sore afraid,
3903	That certain volumes she might read.Adieu she to the matron said
 833	That chosen heroes consecrate,
4478	That crass stupidity misleads,
3135	That every morn at Verrey's cost
4364	That first the Muse appeared to me.
2957	That for that matter in my verse
3529	That, for the century designed,
4623	That girl--but he must dreaming be--
4624	That girl whom once on a time he
1760	That glimmered through the radiant night
4198	That grandmothers and grandsires may
2547	That guests approach: and when above
3460	That heart with inspiration sweet
1580	That Heaven her character had blent
1385	That hero, though his merit shone,
3185	That he was "ready any day."
4984	That I am rich, a prince's wife?--
4343	That I forget not whom I sing.
  91	That is, he could elucidate
4776	That I to you reveal my mind?
1246	That like a friendly voice its tone
4480	That mediocrity alone
4475	That mind which yearns for space is bound?
4382	That my coy Muse might sing more sweet.
4987	That my dishonour would ensure
4573	That Nina's marble symmetry,
4498	That our desires which noblest seemed,
1116	That rascal Lovelace she abused;
3611	That soon I reach my thirtieth year?And so my noon hath come! If so,
3274	That the two friends with morning's light
3128	That, tipsy once in actual fight,
2121	That until Christmas comes again
3609	That vanished are my youthful days,
 499	That vicious set whom I don't blame--
4479	That we by cant ourselves deceive,
4496	That we her constantly betrayed
2480	That year the autumn season late
3207	That youthful heart--"But, now at least,
 965	The accents wild of other's woes,
3789	The aged mother, bathed in tears,
1530	The aged nurse in ample gown,
1520	The aged woman in her woe:
1590	The all-entrancing joys of love--
3455	The altar flame was quenched in night.Tranquil he lay, and strange to view
 106	The amatory science warm,
 774	The ancient _barshtchina_ replaced
1232	The appointed hour arrives, arrives!
1624	The artful prisoner should seek
4813	The artifice of villany--
2970	The aspect of a landscape drear.
3446	The avalanche of snow first bends,
3000	The ball in all its splendour shone.I tried when I began this tale,,
2380	The balls impelled, the blunt cue chalked;
3219	The bard his answer waits at home,
3920	The bard of Juan and the Giaour,
2768	The bard's enthusiastic strain,
1150	The bath on Saturdays attended,
1260	The bays of age and helplessness.
2650	The bear rolls on with many a grunt:
3670	The bee forth from his cell of wax
3862	The beldam saith: "The hearth, by it
3533	The blessings of humanity.Or, it may be, the bard had passed
3462	The blood boiled and the passions strove.
3458	The blood gushed from the wound and steamed
 625	The body they consigned to rest,
  36	The boy was wild but full of grace.
3681	The breath of Spring again renewed,
1131	The bridegroom sage without delay
1874	The bridge and alley to the lake,
4570	The brilliant Nina Voronskoi,
4004	The calm existence which I prize
2846	The captain of a company.
 681	The captives of the Salguir's shore.
3717	The chaise long ordered please employ,
4025	The channel of the river stilled
2775	The chief of the Chaldean wise,
 655	The child of sloth and liberty.
1852	The china teapot too ye might
 177	The choicest flowers of French cuisine,
2580	The clue unto some mystery
4146	The coach before a house stood still.
4133	The coach is borne o'er ruts and holes,
 923	The cold reply with gloomy mien
3448	The cold sweat bursting from his brow,
2849	The colonel sent it. Oh! delight!
3695	The coming of life's Autumn drear.
2914	The company deep silence guard.
3482	The comrade of your youth should strike,
4287	The connoisseur his glances throws
 412	The contact of the foot I raised
 870	The conversation tedious
4658	The conversation was revived
 945	The converse of our hermits twain,
4249	The converse of the world polite,
 636	The cool dark oaken grove to range,
3983	The counsel good and full of reason,
1261	The Country DamselCanto The Third"Whither away? Deuce take the bard!"--
2083	The country hath its liberties
 146	The crafty spouse caressed him, who
4290	The crash of music, candles' glare
2465	The credulous indeed are blest,
 359	The crowd and merriment and light,
4555	The crowd doth head and shoulders rise
2936	The crowd unto the drawing-room speeds,
4737	The crystals of her vestibule
3849	The curs away to kennel chase,
2319	The curse of commonplace delight.
 223	The curtain now they slowly raise.
1051	The cynosure of every eye.
3850	The damsel under escort place."Can I inspect the mansion, please?"
3742	"_The date, his fleeting years how long--
 545	The days of love and of romance!
1491	The days which to your youth belong?
2096	The deuce take friends, my friends, amends
1302	The deuce with my inside has played."
4829	The die is cast! Thine is my life!
 216	The disenchanted glass direct
2759	The door flew open--Olga came,
2864	The doors swing open: Lenski makes
 206	The drama of my youth was played.
2790	The dream left terror in its train.
1298	The drive becomes monotonous--
 423	The drum already doth arouse.
  79	The dusty chronicles of earth
 552	The early days of life we sought.
4189	The early tinkling of the bells
1936	The easier 'tis to gain her grace,
3759	Thee but a little space bewept,
2031	Thee only, pledge of all things bright,
2029	Thee only would I choose, in truth,
3175	The epistle from the bard presents.
1203	The epitaph on marble shows:
1422	The Eternal Jew or the Corsair
1389	The evanescent fashions fly
1409	The excited hero in a trice
4330	The eyes of a grave general.
1982	The fair, nor parted with regret,
1661	The fair of the next generation,
2426	"The family are all quite well--
3853	The family of children hie.
2830	The family of Kharlikoff,
2243	The fashionable rhymester's heart!
3317	The fatal bullet penetrate,
1345	The fatal hour had come at last--
 936	The fatal secrets of the grave,
3373	The fatal tubes Lepage contrived
1341	The fated nutriment desired;
  96	The father scarcely understands
 129	The feeble moment would espy
 337	The feet of graceful ladies fly,
3005	The feet of my dear lady friends.
 939	The fervid poet would recite,
2477	The Fete
4818	The fever of the blood to slake--
3536	The fire extinguished in his breast,
2720	The fire of the nocturnal lights;
 414	The fires of passion and its smart--
 541	The firmament in mellow light,
2514	The first appearance of the snows
2358	The first bright wreathing storm of snow
5076	The first-fruits of my tale I read,
3827	The fisher's fire afar illumes
4085	The flimsy wares of Western marts,
1876	The flowerbeds skirts, the brook doth meet,
3232	The foaming Lenski would refuse,
3430	The foes, as yet not taking aim,
3402	The foes with downcast eyes abide.Foes! Is it long since friendship rent
2327	The forests in mysterious gloom
3736	The fountain brawls, sweetbriers bloom,
1856	The fragrant tea in darkling stream,
3264	The freshness of her heart impair,
 286	The friend of liberty and laws
2869	The friends are called and quickly placed.Right opposite Tattiana placed,
1908	The frolics of maidens.They sang, whilst negligently seated,
 806	The fruits of learning and combined
 934	The fruits of science, evil, good,
4556	The general who accompanies.
 431	The German baker looks around
  50	The giddy world at last shall see.
 848	The gifted songster never swerved,
5006	The gilding of life's vanities,
1129	The girl in marriage they unite.
2601	The girl on tiptoe forward bounds
3472	The glass unwittingly inspect
2417	The goblet still is bubbling bright--
 300	The goddess would a masquerade
1612	The God of Love is after you!A coquette loves by calculation,
2412	The golden ember now enshrines,
 878	The gossip of their ladies fair.Handsome and rich, the neighbourhood
4354	The Great World
2867	The guests make room; aside each takes
4322	The hamlet, the poor villagers,
 660	The happiest days of life employ?Love, flowers, the country, idleness
 139	The heart of the inveterate flirt!
3667	The heavens shone in deeper blue,
1127	The height of fashion, fitting tight,
  22	The hero is of my narration!
 714	The hero's name too in advance,
2709	The hero we immortalize.
4027	The hoar-frost glitters: all rejoice
1091	The horizon luminous doth grow,
1843	The hostess doth interrogate:
4959	The hour when--Fate so willed--we met
3840	The house and garden I would see."
4039	The household property contain:
3847	The household troop of little boys,
3971	The hussar Pykhtin was accused.
1419	The idols of their adoration
1801	The image of her seal impressed.
2170	The imagination to enliven
4839	The indignation of her heart!
3465	The inmate is for ever dumb,
2209	The "in memoriam" pages sought,
1554	The inscription o'er the gates of Hell
2151	The insensate fire of love still glowed
2654	Their branches by the snow bowed down.
 602	Their claims and explanations shout.
1357	Their coming which no man expects,
1087	Their giddy sports she ne'er enjoyed.She loved upon the balcony
1947	Their glory with their heels of red
4237	Their harmless conversation blends
1402	Their heroes used to represent
1405	Their idols they were wont to invest
4297	Their insolence and waistcoats white
1444	Their Jealousy and separation
 486	Their looks alone produce the spleen.
 366	Their memory lingers still and seems
4010	Their natural attractions lend
1086	Their noisy laugh her soul annoyed,
1442	Their offspring's innocent flirtations
2274	Their own productions, some insist
 386	Their privileged allurements fire
4253	Their slander e'en was weariness;
4244	Their voices nought to her impart
4286	The jealous dame her lorgnette veers,
4088	The journey in a sledge doth please,
 872	The kennel or a kindred line,
4292	The ladies' dresses airy, light,
  69	The ladies' laughter to provoke.
 360	The ladies, their fantastic dress,
4583	The lady in the crimson cap
4595	The lady's glance upon him fell--
 254	The lamps illuminating shine;
3787	The lancer, to his calling bound,
3884	The landscape which the moonbeams fret,
1993	The language of her girlish pleading
4717	The languid eye of love-sick maids,
4258	The languid mind could smile at nought,
4095	The Larinas unwisely went,
2807	The Larinas were since sunrise
2531	The Larinas would celebrate,
2393	The last poor obol I was worth--
 933	The laws of generations past,
4335	"The left? Why, what on earth is there?"--
1831	The letter is the thing, you see,--
1628	The letter which Tattiana wrote.
3266	The lily's stem to eat away,
4323	The little solitary nook
4882	The lively trash of stories long
 731	The lonely mansion-house to screen
1517	"The Lord be with thee, O my daughter!"--
1512	The Lord deliver her and save!
 973	The love, hate, sorrow, joy, we feel.
1946	The Lovelaces are out of date,
4192	The maiden at her casement sits
2925	The maiden's weary eye which yearned,
2854	The maids beside Tattiana keep--
4620	The maid whose note he still possessed
 692	The malady of hopeless love
3416	The mallet loud the ramrod strikes,
3169	The man and liked his company,
3510	The manly toga scarce assumed,
 475	The manners of the highest class
3863	The master always used to sit."Departed Lenski here to dine
1500	The matchmaker a fortnight sped,
3190	The matter by his conscience tried,
 752	The matter did not agitate,
1215	The Medal Otchakoff conferred!
  95	The medium is required of gold.
3326	The memory of the bard, a dream,
3821	The memory of the bard was driven
4551	The men salute with lower bows
2848	The military band will play.
3583	The misanthrope of gloomy brow,
3240	The miserable bard to meet,
2529	The misty evenings ere Twelfth Night.
 510	The moderns of the ancients rave--
3017	The moment for revenge, meanwhile,
1417	The monsters of the British Muse
4304	The moon in the blue atmosphere.
1017	The moon, the lamp of heaven above,
1016	The moon, the stars, and shining night--
 288	The most industrious man alive
4293	The motley moving mass and bright,
2308	The murmuring brook, the woodland shade,
3538	The Muse abandoned, ta'en a wife,
3720	The Muse capricious let us coax,
4367	The Muse revealed her first delight,
1592	The mystic lines to tear away
1863	The mystic monogram, O. E.
1506	"Then amongst strangers I was left--
1652	The native Russian tongue impeach?
2128	The natural fickleness of passion,
1136	Then became busy with the house,
1770	Then be it so! My destiny
4592	"Then come with me." The prince proceeds,
2306	Then dressed himself...
1066	The needle nor, o'er framework bent,
 800	The neighbourhood fresh sport derived.
2809	The neighbours come, in sledge approach,
4571	The Neva's Cleopatra, and
2548	The new moon's crescent slim she spied,
3289	Then, eyeing Olga, whispers low:
2370	Then get mad drunk or wroth; the day
3447	Then glittering in the sun descends.
2922	Then handed her the song with grace.Congratulations, toasts resound,
3153	Then he'd malign them secretly
1130	Then, her distraction to allay,
3734	The nightingale there all night long,
1477	The nightingale trills forth her tune;
 574	The nights of golden Italy
4977	"Then, in the country, is't not true?
4851	Then in the silent cabinet
2025	Then, I say truly, none but thee
1251	Then it may be, O flattering tale,
4375	Then my companions young with pleasure
1231	Then seeks ancestral sepulchres,
1816	"Then send your grandson quietly
  68	Then suddenly discharge a joke
4413	Then, the far capital forgot,
 137	Then, then--well, in some solitude
4208	Then the old dames in chorus sing,
1452	Then they came easily enow,
 481	Then they're so innocent of vice,
4239	Then to reward such confidence
1609	Then to some gallant in your turn
2449	Then touching Olga they depart
4182	Then weeping she sank back distressed
 546	Then would we muse as in a trance,
4999	Then ye were barely generous,
 426	The Okhtenka with pitcher speeds,
4373	The old Derjavine noticed me,
1440	The olden time shall be my theme.Old people's simple conversations
4677	The old man who has had his freaks,
3208	The opportunity is flown.
1810	The pains of night have wholly fled,
3351	The pall of night was growing thin,
2993	The Paris of those country parts
3029	The parquet cracked beneath the heel,
1448	The passionate speeches I'll repeat,
  45	The path of hope and tender fear--
 842	The path which leads to glory's goal.
3456	The peace which on his forehead beamed,
 776	The peasant blessed his happy fate.
2586	_The peasants there are rich as kings,
3008	The perfidies I recollect
 811	The pervert world with icy chill
3882	The pile of books, with carpet spread
2346	The pine-torch, by her crackles bright.Already crisp hoar frosts impose
 727	The PoetCanto The SecondThe village wherein yawned Eugene
3818	The poet fell; already men
2997	The poet from Tamboff secured,
2920	The poet, modest though so grand,
 919	The poet's fervid conversation
3441	The poet's hour hath sounded--See!
3198	The poet's madness? for 'tis hard
 149	The pompous, swaggering cuckold too,
2878	The poor girl fell into a faint,
1848	"The post hath kept him, it is like."
3420	The powder in the pan is laid,
 935	The prejudices all men have,
4585	The prince's eye Oneguine seeks:
4153	The princess from the sofa cried
4632	The Princess N. will be at home
 417	The proud ones are not worth the fire
4499	The purest of the dreams we dreamed,
2696	There an imperious skeleton;
3556	The reaping girls approach and ply
2302	There, aping Gulnare's bard, he spanned
4366	There came a sudden flash of light,
 204	There Didelot became glorious,
3111	There dwells five versts from Krasnogory,
 729	There friends of pure delight had been
4337	There, in that knot of company,
3550	There is a spot the village near
2103	There is no fishmarket retort
2657	There is no path; the storm hath strewn
2100	There is no stupid calumny
3754	There is no wreath upon the bough:
 765	There jars of cider block the way,
2986	There'll be a fight. I do not lie.
1211	There long time sad at heart he stayed:
4805	The remnant destiny concedes,
3741	Thereon the passing traveller read:
 200	There our Katenine did revive
2349	There! take it quickly, if ye must).
4289	There the confusion, pressure, heat,
 205	There, there, beneath the side-scene's shade
3555	There the tired ploughman loves to lie,
4542	There was no angling for success.
4443	The rigour of cold pride and all
 817	The riot of the world and glare
3828	The river's bank. Tattiana lone
3733	The river through the linden wood.
3870	The room my former master used.
1658	The Russian language I deem vile
1158	The Russian N with nasal sound
2524	The Russian winter did adore
4087	The ruts of his own fatherland.Yet on a frosty winter day
2599	The sad moon only could remark.
3780	The same unmoved oblivion
1348	The same warm vision constantly;
2115	These are your relatives, believe:
1896	The secrets of maidens.
2452	The secrets of the marriage state
4506	The seemly crowd, partaking nought
2530	These evenings as in days of old
3409	These friends cold-bloodedly draw near
4703	The serpent to unlawful trees
2532	The servants used to congregate
4056	These take their seats; the coach of state
4048	These to the coach of state are bound,
3421	The sharp flint, screwed securely on,
3930	The sharp incisions of his nail,
3561	The shepherd plaits his shoe of bark,
2656	The shining orbs of night appear;
2351	The shining river clothed in ice;
 424	The shopman and the pedlar rise
 429	The shutters open; to the skies
2334	The silent fields no peasant nears,
3571	The simple epitaph--a tear
1369	The sleep-compelling Grandison,
1602	The sneers of critics superfine;
3662	The snows from off the hills around
4921	The snow upon the streets doth melt--
4728	The solstice of our earthly years,
 885	The sorrows of a single state.
2705	The speech of man and tramp of horse.
1090	The starry beacons fade away,
 255	The steed benumbed still pawing stands
 609	The steward sent a note to tell
2955	The stomach doth admonish us.
3453	The storm was hushed. The blossom fair
 981	The story of his young love's dream,
2267	The story of thy life and fate.
4186	The strange apartment her oppressed:
 304	The style in which my hero dressed;
 744	The style of wise antiquity.
 560	The sudden rattling of a car.
1741	The sum of my existence gone
3354	The sun had mounted high his steep,
1365	The swain of Julia Wolmar,
3881	The table with its lamp unlit,
1119	The tale of these romantic men;
2484	The third at night. Tattiana wakes
 377	The thirst for fame and man's applause,
3516	The thirst of knowledge and of fame,
2247	The thunderbolt on you descend!
3568	The tightened leathern rein she draws,
2422	The time between the wolf and dogs--
3711	The time for mystic strolls which late
4853	The time when Melancholy's claw
2325	The tiny sun shone less on high
2051	The tiresome man, her value knowing,
1436	The torment born of crime unseen,
2129	The torrent of opinion,
4687	The traveller, bird of passage he,
2489	The trees in silvery array,
1611	The triumph of a conquest new.
2738	The troop of apparitions fled,
4517	The twenty-sixth year of his age,
3885	The twilight pale which softens all,
2875	The two friends' compliments she hears
4155	The two old ladies then embraced
3988	The unaffected traits she now
2749	The unbidden guests he roughly chides--
2309	The uncontaminated kiss
1732	The untutored spirit's pangs calmed down
3672	The valleys dried and gaily flowered;
3982	The venerable dame opined
4093	The verst posts catch the vacant eye
 526	The very morning of our days.He who hath lived and living, thinks,
4927	The vestibule finds empty quite--
3263	The vile seducer shall not dare
 341	The voice of jealousy is drowned.In my young days of wild delight
3782	The voice of lovers, foes and friends,
 436	The votary of vain delight
4143	The weary way still incomplete,
1326	The wedding-day had been arranged,
3013	The whirlwind of the waltz sweeps by,
3466	The windows whitened, shutters close--
2719	The wind rose instantly, blew out
2930	The witching light of sympathy;
 503	The wit of others to acquire.
2335	The wolf upon the highways bold
2593	The wondrous host of heavenly spheres
3668	The woods, still naked to the view,
 419	The words and looks of charmers sweet
2796	The words _bear, bridge, fir, darkness, bog,
1147	The workpeople she superintended,
1113	The works of Mr. Richardson.She was thus fond of Richardson
5044	The world enough. Congratulate
1391	The world is ever altering!
2510	They are all natural and low,
1227	They blossom, ripen and they fall
1175	They crack a feeble joke and smile--
4226	They deem her somewhat finical,
1889	They disappeared by stealth and guile,
4380	They first of all my brow did wreathe
1174	They growl a bit--they scandalise--
2853	They hand in hand to table go.
2437	They have invited you this week.""Me?"--"Yes! It is Tattiana's fete
2862	They laugh, they argue, and they bawl,
1330	They long ago had held debate.
3958	They long at home have her expected--
 640	They made him feel inclined to doze;
2122	They may forget that we exist.
 896	They met. Earth, water, prose and verse,
1307	"The younger, you're in love with her!"
 887	The young proprietor we find;
 197	The young Simeonova too there
1572	The youthful lover once again
 977	The youthful poet's fond confession.
4647	They sat, but conversation's flow
2428	They sent their compliments--but oh!
2863	They shout and no one lists at all.
2587	They shovel silver with a spade,
 966	They stir the heart as heretofore.
4657	They talked and laughed. The guests arrived.
4878	They were the wonderful traditions
1288	They will receive us with delight."
1639	They wish that ladies should, I hear,
2239	They would not solemnly debate
1747	Thine eye subdued me with strange glance,
1785	Thine honour is my countersign!Tattiana moans and now she sighs
 925	Thinking: 'tis foolish to disturb
2355	Thinking to float upon the stream,
 773	This anchorite amid his waste
1887	(This by command; for it was found,
 926	This evanescent boyish bliss.
1699	This gentle daring who could guess?
5011	This glitter, riot, emptiness,
1141	This great discovery relief
 825	This he believed: a kindred spirit
3866	This is my master's sitting-room.
5010	This life in masquerade concealed,
2060	This lot in life with stern decree?"Ideas and time ne'er backward move;
2778	This monument of thought profound
 506	This nonsense, that dishonest seems,
4785	This separated us as well--
4800	This, this were true felicity!
 796	This was his social character.
 507	This wicked, that absurd he deems,
1243	This world. I do not praise desire,
4299	Thither hussars on leave will stray
3902	Thither in future to proceed
 369	Those feet? Alas! on what far strand
2730	Those hellish phantoms. Peals arise
2116	Those whom we ought to love, caress,
5062	Thou also, my ideal true,
4002	Thou beauteous sky above, farewell!
1745	Thou didst to me in dreams appear,
2978	Though around honoured Priam's throne
2246	Though Baratynski verses penned,
1977	Though beauty he no more adored,
4257	Though by an error and unsought--
 914	(Though certainly mankind he knew
4767	Though correspondence as a rule
4574	Though dazzling its effulgence white,
2498	Though deep he sinks into the drift;
2975	Though for his Helen Menelaus
 465	Though, God be praised! he ne'er designed
3436	Though he advanced unceasingly.
4605	Though he surveyed her at his ease,
1635	Though hitherto a lady ne'er
 305	Though I confess I hardly dare
3588	Though I'll return to him right early,
4353	Though late, have a beginning made.
2039	Though now my love might be intense,
3337	Though of romance therein I fail
 943	Though scarcely following what was said,
2090	Though some men, evilly disposed,
1105	Though superannuated rather;
2800	Though the foul vision promise made
 313	Though to the Academy I come
2458	Though we, of Hymen foes, meanwhile,
2323	Though we will not acknowledge it.
 643	Though without palaces and streets,
1455	Thou hast resigned thy destiny
1461	Thou'lt quaff love's sweet envenomed stream,
1457	Thou'lt suffer, dearest, but before,
4006	Thou too farewell, my liberty!
  31	Three balls a year he gave ye duly,
3136	Three flasks of wine he might exhaust.
 296	Three mortal hours per diem he
 363	Three pairs of handsome female feet;
1188	Three tears they dropt with humble mein
 949	Thrice happy who their agonies
2655	Through aspens, limes and birches bare,
  16	Through clouds of dust at postal pace,
4431	Through dense aristocratic rows
1873	Through park and meadow, wood and brake,
1193	Thus age approached, the common doom,
1984	Thus a guest with composure will
 679	Thus carelessly I once portrayed
4627	Thus haughty, careless in her tone?He quits the fashionable throng
1431	Thus having braved Apollo's rage
2567	Thus her perversity hath shown.
1337	Thus in the earth the seed expands
  15	Thus mused a madcap young, who drove
2566	Thus Nature doth our souls alloy,
 904	Thus oft--this I myself confess--
1229	Thus our light race grows up and lives,
  59	Thus, praised be God! a reputation
1919	Thus shakes the hare when suddenly
1916	Thus shines the wretched butterfly,
1176	Thus the time passes and meanwhile
2262	Thus thou, Yazykoff, dost arise
1267	Thus to assassinate the eve?"--
2067	Thus trees in spring their leaves renew
 618	Thus we began our little tale--
1811	Thy cheek is as a poppy red!""Ah! nurse, a favour do for me!"--
3802	Thy dove, thy darling little pet
2965	Thy heroes, sanguinary wights,
 689	Thy meditative incantation--
2967	Thy Venus and thy Jupiter,
2200	Till absently Vladimir took
2677	Till amid trees a hovel showed,
 321	Till carriage lamps, a double row,
2483	Till January fell no snow--
 440	Till morn--life uniform but gay,
1877	Till out of breath upon a seatShe sank.--
1328	Till proper rings could be procured.
1912	Till the fire in her cheek decreased;
3051	Till the mazurka's close he stays,
4121	Time-honoured Kremlin's keys present.
 582	Time, I invoke thee! favouring gales
2952	Time to denote by dinner, tea,
1399	Time was, a valiant general might
3137	Time was, his raillery was gay,
3744	Time was, the breath of early dawn
3123	Time was the flattering voice of fame,
1395	Time was, the poet's tender quill
3748	Time was, two maidens from their home
1939	Time was when cold seduction strove
 711	Time will the ravages efface--
 927	Time without me will lessons give,
 435	Tired by the ball's incessant noise,
1352	Tiresome unto her hath become
1311	'Tis a Madonna of Vandyk,
4161	'Tis a scene of romance, I vow!"
 166	'Tis dark. He seats him in a sleigh,
1797	'Tis day, the family downstairs,
3075	'Tis done. To supper they proceed.
4508	'Tis dreadful--ye agree, I hope--
2069	'Tis evidently Heaven's will
4502	'Tis fearful to anticipate
1782	'Tis finished. Horrible to read!
2034	'Tis foreign to my cast of thought;
1294	"'Tis habit, Lenski."--"Is your ill
1740	'Tis Heaven's will and I am thine.
3867	'Tis here he slept, his coffee took,
4847	'Tis hopeless! Homeward doth he flee
1709	'Tis in your power now, if desired,
4320	'Tis noisome to her there: in thought
3031	'Tis not so now. Like gentle dames
4009	'Tis now the hillock now the rill
3703	'Tis now the season! Idlers all,
1724	'Tis said you are a misanthrope,
 557	'Tis silent all! Alone the cries
2619	'Tis silent all. Tattiana sleeps.
1540	'Tis silent--on her shines the moon--
1269	'Tis something of this sort I deem.
4296	'Tis there that arrant fops display
3710	'Tis the warm time of labour, flowers;
1178	'Tis time for supper, now for bed,
1805	"'Tis time, my child, arise, I pray!
2168	'Tis time she to the altar went!
3347	"'Tis time to get up! Seven doth strike.
3964	'Tis time to marry her, 'tis true,
 588	'Tis time to quit this weary shore
 795	'Tis _yes! no!_ never _madam! sir!_"
4444	Titles and ages intermixed.
3368	To accompany him and to escort
 367	To agitate me in my dreams.When, where, and in what desert land,
1320	To all good neighbours' sport conduced.
3966	To all she answers cruelly--
4833	To an assembly--she appeared
1088	To anticipate the break of day,
3926	To arid selfishness resigned,
4824	To arm the tongue and e'en the eye,
 260	To array himself in evening dress.
3255	To ask forgiveness seemed to yearn;
4274	To ask her name the trouble took.
 605	To a surrender gave consent,
2416	Tobacco smoke the flue ascends,
4663	To banish far unworthy themes
 822	To be a charming mystery:
4816	To bear love's parching agonies--
4825	To be in conversation clear
4055	To bid the gentlefolk good-bye.
3374	To bring behind: the triple steeds
4817	To burn, yet reason keep awake
3973	To captivate her how devoted!
 126	To cheat the inexperienced fair,
4300	To clank the spur, delight the fair--
4352	To classicism I've homage paid,
3230	To cock the pistol; barrel bend
 181	To cool the cutlets' seething grease,
2402	To cope with Ay no more I dare,
1710	To crush me with a just disdain.
4962	To-day it is my turn to teach.
1930	To-day, my friends, at any rate,
1459	To dire contentment shall give birth
1145	To dominate her worthy lord,
1238	To dreams I long have closed mine eyes,
 590	To dream upon the sunny strand
 888	To Dunia then they whisper: Mind!
1757	To ease the anguish of my breast.
4719	To end with him her path below.To Love all ages lowly bend,
4701	To Eve the universal mother,
1057	To fawn upon and love express;
4251	To find in gossip such delight,
3249	To flight before her radiant look,
4794	To follow you in every place,
 861	To foreign lands he would allude,
2505	To freeze his finger hath begun,
3165	To friendship making no pretence,
4646	Together moments one or two
2081	Together they returned, nor word
5043	Together we have wandered o'er
4412	To God eternal hymns of praise.
1264	To guess how you the eve pull through."--
4044	To happiness contributing.
2635	To help her to the other shore
4268	To her an elegy composed.
1207	To his Penates now returned,
2374	To idle musing was a prey;
3195	To jest as he had done last eve,
 399	To kiss the feet which I admired!
2495	To labour in his sledge forgot,
4590	"To--?"--"Larina."--"Tattiana?"--"So.
4996	To lawless love I should prefer--
2609	To lay two covers secretly.
2439	Told me to ask you. Ere that date
2841	To light had brought them from their dust,
 637	To listen to the rippling rill.
1720	To listen to the words you speak,
 163	To loiter there in idleness
4504	To look on life as on a show,
3352	To Lucifer the cock must breathe
3139	To make wise men the idiot play
 241	To male acquaintances he bows,
4389	To many a noisy feast and fight,
3993	To mark with a contemptuous smile.
1216	To me he would his Olga give,
3260	To mention the foregoing eve,
2780	Tome of "Malvina," and but three
3229	To-morrow before break of day,
 441	To-morrow just like yesterday.
4171	To-morrow Tania we will show,
4983	To move in fashionable life,
2555	To mutter her concealed desire
2283	To my old nurse alone peruse,
3439	Took aim--but as immediately
2994	To Olga Petoushkova darts:
 312	Too much I'm given to intersperse,
4341	To our Tattiana conquering,
5049	To part in amity with thee!
3080	To pass the night at home hath gone.
4509	To pass with reasonable men
2572	To peer into the future tries.
2256	To purest love he tuned his note
2861	To raise a clamour and a din:
3435	To raise his pistol to his eye,
1059	To romp and play she ne'er would go:
 566	Torquato Tasso's strains I deem.
4939	Tortured by pangs of wild regret,
1685	To russify the foreign phrase
 308	To Russ indigenous are not;
3796	To say farewell, and fussed and fumed
1906	To secrets of virgins,
3338	To see aught--never mind meanwhile)
3233	To see his Olga ere the fray--
4123	To seek him out with bended head.
1719	To see you by our fireside stand,
5004	To shallow sentiment a slave!
  13	To sigh and meditate alone:
 669	To sketch myself that I have tried
3002	To sketch ye in Albano's style.
 466	To slay himself with blade or ball,
2139	To standards in which we believe?
4011	To stay the maid against her will.
4295	To strike imagination serve.
1557	To such--delightful to repel.
1940	To swagger as the art of love,
4741	To swathe her shoulders in the furs,
1985	To take a hand at whist oft come:
1817	To take this letter to O-- Well!
2995	To Tania Lenski; Kharlikova,
3906	To the abandoned dwelling-place.
2278	To the fair object of his dream,
1589	To the impressions of our youth,
3287	To the pianoforte he moves
 537	To the sarcastic observation,
 188	To the theatre he repairs
3293	To the young girl he said adieu,
3449	To the youth Eugene hurried now--
3391	To this arrangement can be seen,
2018	To thy decree my will I bend.
3224	To treat the matter as a jest,
3375	To two young oaks the coachman leads.
3943	To understand by slow degrees
 634	To vary for a few brief days.For two whole days it seemed a change
3329	To visit, lovely maid, return,
3985	To visit Moscow in the season.
 635	To wander through the meadows still,
4796	To watch with lovers' ecstasies,
4777	To what malicious merriment,
1763	To whisper comfort, love and hope?
 685	To whom amongst the jealous throng
2142	To whom are our misfortunes grief
1821	"To whom is it to go, my sweet?
1018	To whom we used to consecrate
1645	To whom ye for unnumbered crimes
1647	To whom your hearts were consecrate,--
 538	To witticisms and taunts half-vicious
4759	To write his forefathers to warn
 713	To write in cantos twenty-five.I've thought well o'er the general plan,
 672	To write of any other elf
2176	To youthful Olga's beauty bright,
1988	Tranquilly goes to sleep at home,
3079	Tranquil repose. Eugene alone
4614	Transfixed Oneguine mine doth stay.Is this the same Tattiana, say,
 540	Transparent o'er the Neva beamed
 463	Transported to our Russian clime.
3415	Trembles at artificial shame.The shining pistols are uncased,
2252	Trembles upon my lips from spite,--
4644	Trembling he seeks the young princess--
2913	Triquet arose, and for the bard
2893	Triumphant by anticipation,
3221	Triumphant with the answer come.
2979	Troy's sages should in concert own
3120	True friend, landlord benevolent,
3183	Turned and replied as it behoved,
2916	Turned to her and discordantly
 741	'Twas built, the venerable pile,
4714	'Twas he whom, amid nightly shades,
2088	'Twas not the first time, I can tell
 759	'Twas plain--an oaken floor ye scan,
5019	"'Twas possible then, happiness--
1014	'Twas then he loved the tangled grove
4361	'Twas then in valleys lone, remote,
4876	'Twas these he read and these alone
2568	Twelfth Night approaches. Merry eves!
1183	Twice in the year to fast were bound,
 760	Two cupboards, table, soft divan,
4338	Two dressed in uniform appear--
2228	Two hearts, a torch, of flowers a wreath,
3823	Two hearts perchance were desolate
2005	Two minutes they in silence spent,
3552	Two pines have joined their tangled roots,
2628	Two poles together glued by ice,
4566	'Twould serve ye in an epigram--
  76	Two verses he could recollect
3014	Undeviating and insane
3212	Undoubtedly, disdain alone
2615	Undressed herself and went to bed
4264	Unfavourable unto her.
2899	Unhappily too salt by far;
 997	Unknown as yet the aching heart,
4447	Unknown to all he doth appear,
4789	Unknown to all, without a tie,
4705	Unless forbidden fruit we eat,
1008	Unseen in thick and tangled grass
1746	Unseen thou wast already dear.
1911	Until her heart less high should bound--
2672	Until her powers of running fail.She sank upon the snow. But Bruin
 164	Until the sleepless Breguet chime
3989	Unto a carping world must show--
3852	Unto Anicia for the keys
1456	Unto a ruthless tyrant dread.
4613	Unto her husband, went away--
 778	Unto his neighbour, man of thrift,
4924	Unto his own Tattiana he,
1818	Unto our neighbour. Mind you tell--
3996	Unto the fields she makes her way,
4054	Unto the gates the servants fly
3040	Unto the hero of this lay
2777	Unto their solitude one day,
4409	Unto the sounding sea to list,
3228	Unto the windmill he must ride
1189	Upon a bunch of lovage green;
3687	Upon a soul inert and cloyed?--
4843	Upon her brow sits wrath alone--And it may be a secret dread
3047	Upon her cheek by adulation
1541	Upon her elbow she reclines,
1788	Upon her tongue which fever bakes.
3357	Upon his couch insensibly;
1862	Upon its damp opacity,
 652	Upon my lake I love to float,
3599	Upon my visions such intrude.Fresh aspirations I have known,
 392	Upon the ball-room's glassy floor
 786	Upon the Don's broad pastures bred
 373	Upon the dreary northern snows,
2329	Upon the earth a mist did lie
 585	Upon the highway of the sea
3560	Upon the meadows showering,
2222	Upon the opening page ye find:
 243	Upon the stage his weary glance.
3860	Upon the tumbled sofa placed,
2488	Upon the windows tracery,
3937	Upon those margins she perceived
1378	Upon those pages she descries
 350	Upon your daughters keep an eye,
3078	Up to the attic, and all need
2414	Upward in a thin stream inclines.
 489	Urging your droshkies swift as air
2977	Us, and like Trojan warriors slay us;
3225	Use subterfuge, and thus his breast
1234	Us from the world wherein we live.Meantime, drink deeply of the flow
3535	Vanished his youthful years at last,
4436	Variety of speech and vests,
1285	Verses and tears et cetera.
4639	Vexation? Vanity? or strove
1412	Vice had due punishment awarded,
1415	Vice in romance is glorified
1108	Viewed them with not a little scorn,
 736	Villages in the distance show
1561	Virgins miraculous I see,
1413	Virtue was with a bride rewarded.But now our minds are mystified
4629	Visions, now sad, now grateful, long
3304	Vladimir closes up his book,
3739	"_Vladimir Lenski lies beneath,
1208	Vladimir Lenski visited
 801	Vladimir Lenski was his name,
1315	Vladimir something curtly said
3112	Vladimir's property, a man
4396	Vociferously paid her court,
2918	Voices and hands applaud, and she
 195	Von Wisine, friend of liberty,
 893	Vows matrimonial to break,
3698	Wafted upon poetic wing,
 828	Waiting his coming--his alone!
2360	Walking? The landscape tires the eye
3650	Wallow, my friends, in company!
4780	Warmth I imagined in your glance,
2683	"Warm yourself here a little space!"
 728	Was a delightful little spot,
  24	Was born beside the Neva, where
1386	Was certainly no Grandison.
 873	Was certainly not erudite
5081	Was drawn, ideal of my lay--
3283	Was famous for thick-headedness.Lenski that eve in thought immersed,
 447	Was he in health and void of care?--Even so! His passions soon abated,
2394	Was it not so?--for thee I gave,
1759	Was it not thou, O vision bright,
1762	Was it not thou who thus didst stoop
 462	Was nothing but the British spleen
3171	Was not surprised thereby at all.
1410	Was ready for self-sacrifice,
3350	Was sleeping then a sleep like death;
 294	Was that which we are wont to call
3245	Was the first question Olga made,
4969	Was the meek love a maiden feels.
4037	Was the old and forgotten coach;
3774	Was the sad poet filled with gloom,
2754	Was uttered, and the cabin shook--
3454	Was withered ere the morning light--
3191	Was with himself dissatisfied.In fact, the subject analysed,
3873	Was wont with me at cards to play.
1944	Was worthy of that old baboon,
1498	Was younger than myself, my light,
  57	We all of us of education
1036	We are the first who such a name
4518	Wearied of leisure in the end,
 544	We called to mind our youthful days--
1504	Weeping they loosed my tresses long
3032	We glide along a floor of wax.
 964	We hear with interest intense
1308	"Well!"--"I the elder should prefer,
3244	Well! just as she was yesterday."Why did you leave last night so soon?"
4846	Well known unto Oneguine mine.
1299	Well! Larina appears to us
3811	Well nigh her heart in twain was cleft.In cruel solitude each day
1043	We must admit but little taste
1493	"We never loved in days of old,
1309	Were I like you a bard by trade--
2328	Were stripped with melancholy sound,
 938	Were to analysis subjected.
1492	Were you in love when you were young?"--"Alack! Tattiana," she replied,
1367	Werther, rebellious martyr bold,
4200	We Russians, friends from distant parts
2119	We visit about Christmas Day,
4773	What acrimonious scorn I trace
3677	What agitation languidly
1481	"What ails thee, dear?"--"I feel depressed.
3296	"What ails thee?"--"Nothing."--He is fled.At home arriving he addressed
5009	What are they? Gladly would I yield
5035	What a storm of emotions keen
1454	What bitter tears with thee I shed!
 290	What boots it with the age to strive?
3961	"What can be done? She is no child!"
2047	"What can be drearier than the house,
4775	What do I ask? What cause assigned
4459	What doth he act? Is it Melmoth,
2691	What doth she see? Around the board
1952	What everybody long has known;
4166	"What! Grandison?"--"Yes, certainly!"
4636	What hath he dreamed? What hath occurred?
2114	What I by relatives conceive?
 154	What, invitations? The same day
4458	What is his latest character?
1830	What is thy cleverness to me?
2604	"What is your name?" The boor looked dazed,
1323	What jokes and guesses now abound,
 118	What languor would his silence show,
  55	What more's required? The world replies,
2258	What never was remarked or heard
1488	What once I knew is clean forgot--
2045	What pleasures Hymen would prepare
1281	What! really going? 'Tis too bad!
3679	What sad emotions o'er me steal
4172	What say you? to the family--
1292	What they in conversation said?--
4953	What visions then her fancy thronged--
3313	What will the coming dawn reveal?
3795	When all around the entrance pressed,
1151	When angry beat her maids, I grieve,
1918	When captured in a schoolboy's cap;
3493	When deaf and silent he doth lie
2248	Whene'er a brilliant courtly dame
3565	Whene'er across the plain at speed
 457	Whene'er he had an aching head;
1925	When Eugene like a ghost did rise
2381	When evening o'er the landscape looms,
3680	When first upon my cheek I feel
 814	When Friendship smiled or Love caressed.
1565	When harsh demeanour hath consigned
2517	When he in ardent verse portrays
3508	When hope's delightful flower but bloomed
2135	When in as instant she is lost,--
2557	When in her walks abroad she met
2056	When in simplicity ye wrote
2707	When in that company she saw
2989	When in the grand saloon was heard
3907	When in the study's calm retreat,
4106	When I yon semicircle bright
3490	When motionless your gaze beneath
2420	When o'er a glass with friends we prate
1089	When on the pallid eastern sky
 959	When Passion's fire no longer glows
1186	When people with long countenance
2272	When poets lachrymose recite
1597	When separation's hour drew nigh,
 586	When shall I wing my passage free
4905	When, sitting by his fire alone
2951	When tea was brought. 'Tis my delight
 712	When that time comes, a poem I'll strive
3791	When the hour came to bid good-bye--
3027	When the mazurka used to peal,
1070	When the obedient doll in sport
 439	When the same life before him lies
 182	When the sonorous Breguet tells
2569	When thoughtless youth whom nothing grieves,
4062	When to enlarge we shall succeed,
 581	When will my hour of freedom come!
  14	When will the devil take his own!"
  43	When youth's rebellious hour drew near
4622	Where all upon the surface lies,--
1687	Where art thou? Come! pretensions mine
3658	Where better?
3551	Where dwelt the Muses' worshipper,
 189	Where each young critic ready stands,
4527	Where every day before his eyes
2106	Where fashionable circles meet
4981	Wherefore am I your quarry held?--
2564	Wherefore? She found a secret joy
1133	Where God alone knows whom she met.
3645	Where harsh frivolity proclaims
 217	Where I can no more recollect?--
3857	Wherein a space Oneguine spent.
 594	Wherein I buried left my heart.
4866	Wherein I castigation get;
 593	Wherein I felt love's fatal dart,
1544	Wherein love innocently pines.
5017	Wherein my poor old nurse doth lie
 263	Wherein the child of fashion strict
3723	Where in the country Eugene yet,
4621	Wherein the heart its vows expressed,
2048	Wherein the miserable wife
2004	Wherein we lately left the twain.
2137	Where is he who doth not deceive?
3581	Where is the outlaw, banned by men,
 862	Where long time he in solitude
3659	        Where man is not.
2210	Where many another hand had signed
1690	Where melancholy rocks arise
3625	Where my days in the wilderness
4410	Where Nereids murmur evermore,
 982	Where plentifully feelings flow
4324	Where shining runs the tiny brook,
 844	Where sometime Goethe, Schiller sung,
5015	Where the first time I saw your face,--
4327	Where the first time she met with _him_.Thus widely meditation erred,
3653	Where thine equal shall we find?
3180	Whereto in language courteous
4059	Where turmoil cannot penetrate,
1279	Where--"--"What! another eclogue spin?
4841	Where, where, remorse, compassion, pain?
4842	Where, where, the trace of tears? None, none!
3604	Where youth ?
 678	Which afterwards the muse revived.
2216	Which all her darling friends have scrawled
3690	Which Autumn late to earth consigned,
4709	Which crushing dignity must brook!
2359	Which falls in starry flakes below.How in the country pass this time?
2241	Which from the devil's bookcase start,
 996	Which glowed with virginal desire.When but a boy he Olga loved
3731	Which in a hilly neighbourhood
4560	Which in the elevated sphere
3719	Which in the winter were a joy:
3489	Which in your spirit dominates,
3950	Which is he? or an imitation,
4865	Which lessons unto us repeat,
2214	Which might for many ages last.Surely ye all have overhauled
1111	Which 'neath her pillow lay till morn.
1955	Which never have existed, e'en
4070	Which o'er the waters boldly leap,
4190	Which of approaching labour tells
 107	Which Ovid once immortalized,
3271	Which rankled in Tattiana's breast,
 396	Which rushed in eager dense array
 323	Which shines with iridescent hues.
1924	Which to the neighbouring alley leads,
 983	Which we experienced long ago.Alas! he loved as in our times
2105	Which your true friend with a sweet smile
1531	Whilst all creation seemed to dream
4906	Whilst cheerily the embers shone,
 942	Whilst Eugene condescending quite,
4329	Whilst from her countenance ne'er stirred
2842	Whilst he "belle Nina" had the face
1289	Whilst homeward by the nearest route
4715	Whilst Morpheus his approach delays,
 738	Whilst nearer, sunk in deeper shade,
3087	Whilst on the floor Monsieur Triquet
 422	Whilst Petersburg from slumber deep
3785	Whilst struggling for the heritage.Soon Olga's accents shrill resound
1002	Whilst the fond parents, friends thro' life,
 249	Whilst the tired serving-men without
2734	Whiskers and bloody tongues and horns,
4102	White Moscow raises her old spires,
4922	Whither along them doth he pelt?Oneguine whither gallops? Ye
4007	Whither and wherefore do I speed
 317	Whither at headlong speed doth go
3467	Whither departed is the host?
 158	Whither shall he go first? He'll see,
 157	Whither shall my rapscallion flit?
1990	Whither that evening he will go.
3959	Whither two neighbouring dames have walked
2832	Who arrived lately from Tamboff,
1764	Who art thou? Guardian angel sent
3483	Who by a haughty word or glance
3655	Who can help loving mother Moscow?
 210	Who cannot conjure former joys?
2776	Who dreams expound and prophecies.Brought by a pedlar vagabond
3364	Who dressing-gown and slippers gives
3740	Who early died a gallant death_,"
2473	Who every gesture, every phrase
 150	Who floats contentedly through life,
 697	Who following Petrarch move along
 550	Who for the greenwood quits his tower,
2823	Who from two years to thirty tell;
4491	Who glory, wealth and dignities
4148	Who had for four long years survived
2293	Who, heard the music of my lay,
2407	Who in the agony of grief
1885	Who in the orchards gathered fruit,
2226	_Who in thy love finds more delight
4340	"Who? Is it that stout general, pray?"--Let us congratulations pay
1607	Who knows? with love's consuming flame
2141	Who labours hard to humour us?
2561	Wholly beside herself with fear,
2118	Whom, as the custom is of men,
3945	Whom autocratic fate's decrees
4452	Who may he be? Is it Eugene?
 684	Whom doth thy plaintive Muse adore?
 690	Whom hath thy strain immortalized?
 955	Whom jealous transport cannot move,
 488	Whom latterly one often meets
3092	Whom pale Diana's ray illumes--
2961	Whom thirty centuries adore.I will with thy divinity
1604	Whom vice, if named, doth agitate
2763	Whom you in slumber may have seen."But she, her sister never heeding,
4937	Who now could fail to recognize
2277	Who reads his visionary theme
2190	Whose author nature understood
2472	Whose brain no fond illusions daze,
4103	Whose countless golden crosses glow
 779	Who secretly denounced the gift,
 687	Whose glance reflecting inspiration
1259	Whose hands indulgently caress
2475	Whose heart experience icy made
1588	Whose hearts responsive have remained
1562	Who selfishly unmoved remain
3700	Whose memories make the heart beat quick
1257	Whose memory doth not refuse
1123	Whose qualities appeared to afford
 571	Whose tones Apollo's sons inspire,
5086	Who the romance do not complete,
1700	Who this soft nonsense could impart,
3113	Who thrives this moment as I write,
3134	Who to surrender did not blench
4438	Who to the youthful hostess bowed,
3038	Who tyrannizes us with ease,
1272	Who welcome guests with zeal extreme,
2444	"Who will be there?"--"The family.
3848	Who with a scuffle and a shout
  21	Who without more prevarication
4584	Who with the Spanish envoy speaks?"--
2138	Who words and actions will adjust
4158	"Who would have thought it? As of yore!
4710	Who would the maiden innocent
1497	"Why, as God ordered! My Ivan
1728	Why did you visit our poor place?
3327	Will be absorbed by Lethe's stream;
1610	Will be ascribed by treacherous Fame
4791	Will happiness replace. My God!
1883	Will he pursue?--But no one came.
4064	Will not five centuries exceed
1249	Will not, preserved by kindly Fate,
2371	Will pass; the same to-morrow try--
4772	Will sound an insult in your ear.
1663	Will teach grammatical conceits,
1666	Will to the old times faithful be.Speech careless, incorrect, but soft,
2446	Will you?"--"Agreed."--"I thank you, friend,"
4910	Winter resigned her empire white,
4030	Winter's approach she doth not hail
2494	Winter! The peasant blithely goes
1047	With affectation,--nothing more.
 240	With all dissatisfaction shows.
2822	With all their progeny were there,
1581	With an imagination wild,
3262	With ardent sighs and flattery
3842	With bated breath, around she bends
3083	With better half as cumbersome;
5023	With bitter tears my mother prayed,
4086	With blessings on the ditches and
1154	With blood instead of ink she scrawled,
4682	With blunted pencil-point adorns.
2627	With boiling torrent dark and gray;
2764	With book in hand reclined in bed,
1903	With cherries, red currants,
2577	With childlike lisp will lie to please.
4446	With clouded brow stands silently?
1898	With dance and with song.
1200	With deeper woe than others' grief.
2877	With effort she restrains. Well nigh
3469	With epigrams impertinent,
4655	With Eugene pranks of former years
3932	With eye precise and without fail.
2652	With fir-trees standing motionless
3812	With flame more ardent passion burns,
3888	With folded arms and eyes bent low,
2644	With footsteps tremulous with awe
1068	With gay design and silken stitch.
3055	With great delight.--O God on high!
4231	With her they did associate,
 145	With him were friends eternally:
3928	With his exasperated sense,
2336	With his ferocious mate appears.
2201	With his own pawn alas! his rook!Homeward returning, he at home
 191	With hisses Cleopatra scares,
1620	With hope and then perplexity,
2155	With hopeless passion: from her bed
1432	With humble prose I'll fill my page
 331	With hurried hand smooths down his hair.
1667	With inexact pronunciation
2874	Within her; she is sick at heart;
  82	Within his memory there lay,
4694	Within his mind Tattiana bore,
3502	Within his sledge the stiffened corse,
3557	Within its wave the sounding pail,
1484	Within my memory I bore
2681	Within resounded shriek and shout:
1582	With intellect and strong volition
1406	With intellect, a taste refined,
3192	Within that secret court discussed,
1917	With iridescent wing doth flap
3921	With it may be a couple more;
2399	With its exhilarating flow,
4430	With jealous fear, anxiety.
1622	With jealous fire resuscitate,
3154	With jest and gossip gaily blent.
 532	With late repentance gnaws and stings.
1974	With laughter smothered weariness:
4276	With lengthened howl and accent loud,
1649	With little knowledge and that wrong
2910	With loud explosion, the bright wine
3306	With lovers' rubbish filled, was neat
2171	With love which happiness extends;
 143	With many a snare their pathway line!
3978	With many a vacancy, 'tis said."--
2787	With Martin Zadeka. In woe
3431	With measured step and even gait
4406	With me Caucasian rocks beside!
4241	With mute appeal to ask they seem--
3099	With Olga; nor of this appeared
 228	With one foot resting on its tip
2545	With one paw strokes her face and purrs,
 894	With our Oneguine doth aspire
   8	Without a chance to slip away.
4943	Without amaze or wrath displayed:
  64	Without constraint in conversation
4957	Without disguise ourselves explain.
4481	Without disgust we look upon?Happy he who in youth was young,
1981	Without enthusiasm he met
1659	Without grammatical mistakes.
4243	Without participation hears,
4519	Without profession, business, wife,
1242	Without the faintest trace to leave
1587	Without the ken of parents both,
  54	Without the least constraint he bowed.
5079	Without them Eugene is complete;
 198	With Ozeroff was wont to share
3356	With pallid light, but Eugene lay
3146	With pungent or obtuse retort,
2804	With purple hand Aurora leads,
 976	With quite a lachrymose expression
2454	With rapturous longing he awaits,
1904	With raspberries, cherries.
4671	With roses, caps and looks malign;
2590	With sad refrain misfortune near.
1334	With satisfaction marvellous,
4238	With scandal's trivial ornament.
 627	With serious air then went away
1783	With shame I shudder and with dread--
2058	With so much warmth and intellect?
2117	With spiritual tenderness;
1038	With such a perversity proclaim.
1471	With sudden flush her cheeks suffuse,
 513	With taffety instead of crape.Having abjured the haunts of men,
1599	With tears, confused emotions, bliss,--With unanimity complete,
1020	With tears which secret sufferers love--
 688	With tenderness hath recognized
1754	With thee I conversed when I bore
1675	With the epistle of my fair;
1642	With the "Well-Wisher" in her hand!
1682	With this immoderate request
4654	With this unpleasant _tete-a-tete_,
3701	With thoughts of a far distant land,
2741	With tranquil air Oneguine leads
3620	With tumult or contentment still
  60	With us is easily attained.
4564	With us 'tis quite a novelty
  75	With "vale" finish off a note;
1361	With what avidity and zest
 525	With which blind Fortune oft betrays
 311	With words of foreign origin
3525	With worldly honours, it may be,
3745	Would agitate a mystic wreath
 125	Would at the proper time appear.How well he played the greenhorn's part
2554	Would haste in agitation dire
 297	Would loiter by the looking-glass,
4909	Would lose his slippers or gazette.Time flies! a genial air abroad,
1394	Would once in powdered wig appear;
1061	Would she in silence long remain.Contemplativeness, her delight,
1067	Would she the canvas tight enrich
 820	Would soothe the doubtings of his soul,
1217	Would whisper: shall I so long live?"--
1283	Would you to me this Phyllis show,
 250	Wrapped in their sheepskins soundly sleep.
3908	Wrapt in oblivion complete,
4868	Writ in my honour now and then--
 494	Yawning betook him to a pen.
2244	Yea! although rendered beauteous
3121	Yea! and a man of honour, lo!
3590	Years have inclined me to stern prose,
3591	Years to light rhyme themselves oppose,
 567	Ye billows of blue Hadria's sea,
3520	Ye dreams of heavenly poesy?Perchance to benefit mankind,
2509	Ye feel but little interest,
3312	Ye golden days of my young spring?
4001	Ye groves whose depths I know so well,
3845	Yelping, a pack of dogs rush out,
3705	Ye men of fashion cynical,
 349	Ye mothers also, caution use,
   9	Ye need dissimulation base
3999	"Ye peaceful valleys all, good-bye!
2094	Yes! every one must have his foes,
5013	Yes! for our unpretending home,
3519	Ye shadows of a life more high,
2280	Yes, happy--though she at his side
 479	Yet as a rule their talk I call
4303	Yet clearer shines than every light
2052	Yet curses on his fate bestowing,
4306	Yet dares not, dedicate its strain,
4804	Yet I in idleness expend
3613	Yet let us part in friendship, O
2770	Yet neither Virgil nor Racine
1971	Yet satiated with success,
1239	Yet sometimes banished hopes will rise
2192	Yet sometimes pages two or three
3141	Yet sometimes this or that deceit
1244	Yet still apparently aspire
1880	Yet still her heart, which torments tear,
  81	Yet still of anecdotes a treasure
3602	Yet still remains the old despair.
4769	Yet suffering emotional
4558	Yet viewing her from head to foot,
1333	Yet was her inmost soul o'erjoyed
4823	Yet with a feigned frigidity
4000	Ye well-known mountain summits high,
2502	Yonder the household lad doth run,
1313	Yon silly moon upon the brink
4588	You choose."--"But who is she?"--"My wife.""So thou art wed! I did not know.
2070	You fall in love again. But still--
2007	"You have a letter to me sent.
2089	You, he a noble mind disclosed,
1712	You in the least commiserate
1834	You know that I am now a fool--
1031	You'll find her portrait there, I vouch;
2372	You'll spend your winter famously!
2435	You never since your nose have shown.
1716	You never would have heard the name,
 707	Young ladies' faces and their feet.
1591	Young ladies, if ye ever strove
4294	Young ladies in a vasty curve,
3485	You o'er your wine insulted hath--
4994	Your conversation cold and hard,
1277	"Your fashionable world I hate,
2015	Your frankness I shall compensate
5028	Your heart possesses, I know well,
2057	Your innocent and charming note
 570	Your magic voices I shall greet,
3382	"Your second you have left behind!"
4795	Your smiling lips, your beaming eyes,
2364	Your steed, though rough-shod, cannot keep
4723	Youth freshens beneath Passion's showers,
1713	You will not all abandon me.
4812	You with stern countenance declare
3400	Zaretski and Monsieur Guillot
3395	Zaretski bit his lip in wrath,
3115	Zaretski, once a bully bold,
3425	Zaretski paces thirty-two
3186	Zaretski rose, nor would explain,
3497	Zaretski shouted: "Why, he's killed!"--
3378	Zaretski, village mechanician,
3173	Zaretski with a knowing grin,
2905	Zizi, thou mirror of my mind,










   1	"My uncle's goodness is extreme,
   2	If seriously he hath disease;
   3	He hath acquired the world's esteem
   4	And nothing more important sees;
   5	A paragon of virtue he!
   6	But what a nuisance it will be,
   7	Chained to his bedside night and day
   8	Without a chance to slip away.
   9	Ye need dissimulation base
  10	A dying man with art to soothe,
  11	Beneath his head the pillow smooth,
  12	And physic bring with mournful face,
  13	To sigh and meditate alone:
  14	When will the devil take his own!"
  15	Thus mused a madcap young, who drove
  16	Through clouds of dust at postal pace,
  17	By the decree of Mighty Jove,
  18	Inheritor of all his race.
  19	Friends of Liudmila and Ruslan,
  20	Let me present ye to the man,
  21	Who without more prevarication
  22	The hero is of my narration!
  23	Oneguine, O my gentle readers,
  24	Was born beside the Neva, where
  25	It may be ye were born, or there
  26	Have shone as one of fashion's leaders.
  27	I also wandered there of old,
  28	But cannot stand the northern cold.
  29	Having performed his service truly,
  30	Deep into debt his father ran;
  31	Three balls a year he gave ye duly,
  32	At last became a ruined man.
  33	But Eugene was by fate preserved,
  34	For first "madame" his wants observed,
  35	And then "monsieur" supplied her place;
  36	The boy was wild but full of grace.
  37	"Monsieur l'Abbe" a starving Gaul,
  38	Fearing his pupil to annoy,
  39	Instructed jestingly the boy,
  40	Morality taught scarce at all;
  41	Gently for pranks he would reprove
  42	And in the Summer Garden rove.
  43	When youth's rebellious hour drew near
  44	And my Eugene the path must trace--
  45	The path of hope and tender fear--
  46	Monsieur clean out of doors they chase.
  47	Lo! my Oneguine free as air,
  48	Cropped in the latest style his hair,
  49	Dressed like a London dandy he
  50	The giddy world at last shall see.
  51	He wrote and spoke, so all allowed,
  52	In the French language perfectly,
  53	Danced the mazurka gracefully,
  54	Without the least constraint he bowed.
  55	What more's required? The world replies,
  56	He is a charming youth and wise.
  57	We all of us of education
  58	A something somehow have obtained,
  59	Thus, praised be God! a reputation
  60	With us is easily attained.
  61	Oneguine was--so many deemed,
  62	Pedantic although scholar like,
  63	In truth he had the happy trick
  64	Without constraint in conversation
  65	Of touching lightly every theme.
  66	Silent, oracular ye'd see him
  67	Amid a serious disputation,
  68	Then suddenly discharge a joke
  69	The ladies' laughter to provoke.
  70	Latin is just now not in vogue,
  71	But if the truth I must relate,
  72	Oneguine knew enough, the rogue
  73	A mild quotation to translate,
  74	A little Juvenal to spout,
  75	With "vale" finish off a note;
  76	Two verses he could recollect
  77	Of the AEneid, but incorrect.
  78	In history he took no pleasure,
  79	The dusty chronicles of earth
  80	For him were but of little worth,
  81	Yet still of anecdotes a treasure
  82	Within his memory there lay,
  83	From Romulus unto our day.
  84	For empty sound the rascal swore he
  85	Existence would not make a curse,
  86	Knew not an iamb from a choree,
  87	Although we read him heaps of verse.
  88	Homer, Theocritus, he jeered,
  89	But Adam Smith to read appeared,
  90	And at economy was great;
  91	That is, he could elucidate
  92	How empires store of wealth unfold,
  93	How flourish, why and wherefore less
  94	If the raw product they possess
  95	The medium is required of gold.
  96	The father scarcely understands
  97	His son and mortgages his lands.
  98	But upon all that Eugene knew
  99	I have no leisure here to dwell,
 100	But say he was a genius who
 101	In one thing really did excel.
 102	It occupied him from a boy,
 103	A labour, torment, yet a joy,
 104	It whiled his idle hours away
 105	And wholly occupied his day--
 106	The amatory science warm,
 107	Which Ovid once immortalized,
 108	For which the poet agonized
 109	Laid down his life of sun and storm
 110	On the steppes of Moldavia lone,
 111	Far from his Italy--his own.
 112	How soon he learnt deception's art,
 113	Hope to conceal and jealousy,
 114	False confidence or doubt to impart,
 115	Sombre or glad in turn to be,
 116	Haughty appear, subservient,
 117	Obsequious or indifferent!
 118	What languor would his silence show,
 119	How full of fire his speech would glow!
 120	How artless was the note which spoke
 121	Of love again, and yet again;
 122	How deftly could he transport feign!
 123	How bright and tender was his look,
 124	Modest yet daring! And a tear
 125	Would at the proper time appear.How well he played the greenhorn's part
 126	To cheat the inexperienced fair,
 127	Sometimes by pleasing flattery's art,
 128	Sometimes by ready-made despair;
 129	The feeble moment would espy
 130	Of tender years the modesty
 131	Conquer by passion and address,
 132	Await the long-delayed caress.
 133	Avowal then 'twas time to pray,
 134	Attentive to the heart's first beating,
 135	Follow up love--a secret meeting
 136	Arrange without the least delay--
 137	Then, then--well, in some solitude
 138	Lessons to give he understood!How soon he learnt to titillate
 139	The heart of the inveterate flirt!
 140	Desirous to annihilate
 141	His own antagonists expert,
 142	How bitterly he would malign,
 143	With many a snare their pathway line!
 144	But ye, O happy husbands, ye
 145	With him were friends eternally:
 146	The crafty spouse caressed him, who
 147	By Faublas in his youth was schooled,
 148	And the suspicious veteran old,
 149	The pompous, swaggering cuckold too,
 150	Who floats contentedly through life,
 151	Proud of his dinners and his wife!
 152	One morn whilst yet in bed he lay,
 153	His valet brings him letters three.
 154	What, invitations? The same day
 155	As many entertainments be!
 156	A ball here, there a children's treat,
 157	Whither shall my rapscallion flit?
 158	Whither shall he go first? He'll see,
 159	Perchance he will to all the three.
 160	Meantime in matutinal dress
 161	And hat surnamed a "Bolivar"
 162	He hies unto the "Boulevard,"
 163	To loiter there in idleness
 164	Until the sleepless Breguet chime
 165	Announcing to him dinner-time.
 166	'Tis dark. He seats him in a sleigh,
 167	"Drive on!" the cheerful cry goes forth,
 168	His furs are powdered on the way
 169	By the fine silver of the north.
 170	He bends his course to Talon's, where
 171	He knows Kaverine will repair.
 172	He enters. High the cork arose
 173	And Comet champagne foaming flows.
 174	Before him red roast beef is seen
 175	And truffles, dear to youthful eyes,
 176	Flanked by immortal Strasbourg pies,
 177	The choicest flowers of French cuisine,
 178	And Limburg cheese alive and old
 179	Is seen next pine-apples of gold.
 180	Still thirst fresh draughts of wine compels
 181	To cool the cutlets' seething grease,
 182	When the sonorous Breguet tells
 183	Of the commencement of the piece.
 184	A critic of the stage malicious,
 185	A slave of actresses capricious,
 186	Oneguine was a citizen
 187	Of the domains of the side-scene.
 188	To the theatre he repairs
 189	Where each young critic ready stands,
 190	Capers applauds with clap of hands,
 191	With hisses Cleopatra scares,
 192	Moina recalls for this alone
 193	That all may hear his voice's tone.Thou fairy-land! Where formerly
 194	Shone pungent Satire's dauntless king,
 195	Von Wisine, friend of liberty,
 196	And Kniajnine, apt at copying.
 197	The young Simeonova too there
 198	With Ozeroff was wont to share
 199	Applause, the people's donative.
 200	There our Katenine did revive
 201	Corneille's majestic genius,
 202	Sarcastic Shakhovskoi brought out
 203	His comedies, a noisy rout,
 204	There Didelot became glorious,
 205	There, there, beneath the side-scene's shade
 206	The drama of my youth was played.
 207	My goddesses, where are your shades?
 208	Do ye not hear my mournful sighs?
 209	Are ye replaced by other maids
 210	Who cannot conjure former joys?
 211	Shall I your chorus hear anew,
 212	Russia's Terpsichore review
 213	Again in her ethereal dance?
 214	Or will my melancholy glance
 215	On the dull stage find all things changed,
 216	The disenchanted glass direct
 217	Where I can no more recollect?--
 218	A careless looker-on estranged
 219	In silence shall I sit and yawn
 220	And dream of life's delightful dawn?The house is crammed. A thousand lamps
 221	On pit, stalls, boxes, brightly blaze,
 222	Impatiently the gallery stamps,
 223	The curtain now they slowly raise.
 224	Obedient to the magic strings,
 225	Brilliant, ethereal, there springs
 226	Forth from the crowd of nymphs surrounding
 227	Istomina the nimbly-bounding;
 228	With one foot resting on its tip
 229	Slow circling round its fellow swings
 230	And now she skips and now she springs
 231	Like down from Aeolus's lip,
 232	Now her lithe form she arches o'er
 233	And beats with rapid foot the floor.
 234	Shouts of applause! Oneguine passes
 235	Between the stalls, along the toes;
 236	Seated, a curious look with glasses
 237	On unknown female forms he throws.
 238	Free scope he yields unto his glance,
 239	Reviews both dress and countenance,
 240	With all dissatisfaction shows.
 241	To male acquaintances he bows,
 242	And finally he deigns let fall
 243	Upon the stage his weary glance.
 244	He yawns, averts his countenance,
 245	Exclaiming, "We must change 'em all!
 246	I long by ballets have been bored,
 247	Now Didelot scarce can be endured!"Snakes, satyrs, loves with many a shout
 248	Across the stage still madly sweep,
 249	Whilst the tired serving-men without
 250	Wrapped in their sheepskins soundly sleep.
 251	Still the loud stamping doth not cease,
 252	Still they blow noses, cough, and sneeze,
 253	Still everywhere, without, within,
 254	The lamps illuminating shine;
 255	The steed benumbed still pawing stands
 256	And of the irksome harness tires,
 257	And still the coachmen round the fires
 258	Abuse their masters, rub their hands:
 259	But Eugene long hath left the press
 260	To array himself in evening dress.
 261	Faithfully shall I now depict,
 262	Portray the solitary den
 263	Wherein the child of fashion strict
 264	Dressed him, undressed, and dressed again?
 265	All that industrial London brings
 266	For tallow, wood and other things
 267	Across the Baltic's salt sea waves,
 268	All which caprice and affluence craves,
 269	All which in Paris eager taste,
 270	Choosing a profitable trade,
 271	For our amusement ever made
 272	And ease and fashionable waste,--
 273	Adorned the apartment of Eugene,
 274	Philosopher just turned eighteen.China and bronze the tables weight,
 275	Amber on pipes from Stamboul glows,
 276	And, joy of souls effeminate,
 277	Phials of crystal scents enclose.
 278	Combs of all sizes, files of steel,
 279	Scissors both straight and curved as well,
 280	Of thirty different sorts, lo! brushes
 281	Both for the nails and for the tushes.
 282	Rousseau, I would remark in passing,
 283	Could not conceive how serious Grimm
 284	Dared calmly cleanse his nails 'fore him,
 285	Eloquent raver all-surpassing,--
 286	The friend of liberty and laws
 287	In this case quite mistaken was.
 288	The most industrious man alive
 289	May yet be studious of his nails;
 290	What boots it with the age to strive?
 291	Custom the despot soon prevails.
 292	A new Kaverine Eugene mine,
 293	Dreading the world's remarks malign,
 294	Was that which we are wont to call
 295	A fop, in dress pedantical.
 296	Three mortal hours per diem he
 297	Would loiter by the looking-glass,
 298	And from his dressing-room would pass
 299	Like Venus when, capriciously,
 300	The goddess would a masquerade
 301	Attend in male attire arrayed.On this artistical retreat
 302	Having once fixed your interest,
 303	I might to connoisseurs repeat
 304	The style in which my hero dressed;
 305	Though I confess I hardly dare
 306	Describe in detail the affair,
 307	Since words like pantaloons, vest, coat,
 308	To Russ indigenous are not;
 309	And also that my feeble verse--
 310	Pardon I ask for such a sin--
 311	With words of foreign origin
 312	Too much I'm given to intersperse,
 313	Though to the Academy I come
 314	And oft its Dictionary thumb.
 315	But such is not my project now,
 316	So let us to the ball-room haste,
 317	Whither at headlong speed doth go
 318	Eugene in hackney carriage placed.
 319	Past darkened windows and long streets
 320	Of slumbering citizens he fleets,
 321	Till carriage lamps, a double row,
 322	Cast a gay lustre on the snow,
 323	Which shines with iridescent hues.
 324	He nears a spacious mansion's gate,
 325	By many a lamp illuminate,
 326	And through the lofty windows views
 327	Profiles of lovely dames he knows
 328	And also fashionable beaux.Our hero stops and doth alight,
 329	Flies past the porter to the stair,
 330	But, ere he mounts the marble flight,
 331	With hurried hand smooths down his hair.
 332	He enters: in the hall a crowd,
 333	No more the music thunders loud,
 334	Some a mazurka occupies,
 335	Crushing and a confusing noise;
 336	Spurs of the Cavalier Guard clash,
 337	The feet of graceful ladies fly,
 338	And following them ye might espy
 339	Full many a glance like lightning flash,
 340	And by the fiddle's rushing sound
 341	The voice of jealousy is drowned.In my young days of wild delight
 342	On balls I madly used to dote,
 343	Fond declarations they invite
 344	Or the delivery of a note.
 345	So hearken, every worthy spouse,
 346	I would your vigilance arouse,
 347	Attentive be unto my rhymes
 348	And due precautions take betimes.
 349	Ye mothers also, caution use,
 350	Upon your daughters keep an eye,
 351	Employ your glasses constantly,
 352	For otherwise--God only knows!
 353	I lift a warning voice because
 354	I long have ceased to offend the laws.Alas! life's hours which swiftly fly
 355	I've wasted in amusements vain,
 356	But were it not immoral I
 357	Should dearly like a dance again.
 358	I love its furious delight,
 359	The crowd and merriment and light,
 360	The ladies, their fantastic dress,
 361	Also their feet--yet ne'ertheless
 362	Scarcely in Russia can ye find
 363	Three pairs of handsome female feet;
 364	Ah! I still struggle to forget
 365	A pair; though desolate my mind,
 366	Their memory lingers still and seems
 367	To agitate me in my dreams.When, where, and in what desert land,
 368	Madman, wilt thou from memory raze
 369	Those feet? Alas! on what far strand
 370	Do ye of spring the blossoms graze?
 371	Lapped in your Eastern luxury,
 372	No trace ye left in passing by
 373	Upon the dreary northern snows,
 374	But better loved the soft repose
 375	Of splendid carpets richly wrought.
 376	I once forgot for your sweet cause
 377	The thirst for fame and man's applause,
 378	My country and an exile's lot;
 379	My joy in youth was fleeting e'en
 380	As your light footprints on the green.Diana's bosom, Flora's cheeks,
 381	Are admirable, my dear friend,
 382	But yet Terpsichore bespeaks
 383	Charms more enduring in the end.
 384	For promises her feet reveal
 385	Of untold gain she must conceal,
 386	Their privileged allurements fire
 387	A hidden train of wild desire.
 388	I love them, O my dear Elvine,
 389	Beneath the table-cloth of white,
 390	In winter on the fender bright,
 391	In springtime on the meadows green,
 392	Upon the ball-room's glassy floor
 393	Or by the ocean's rocky shore.
 394	Beside the stormy sea one day
 395	I envied sore the billows tall,
 396	Which rushed in eager dense array
 397	Enamoured at her feet to fall.
 398	How like the billow I desired
 399	To kiss the feet which I admired!
 400	No, never in the early blaze
 401	Of fiery youth's untutored days
 402	So ardently did I desire
 403	A young Armida's lips to press,
 404	Her cheek of rosy loveliness
 405	Or bosom full of languid fire,--
 406	A gust of passion never tore
 407	My spirit with such pangs before.Another time, so willed it Fate,
 408	Immersed in secret thought I stand
 409	And grasp a stirrup fortunate--
 410	Her foot was in my other hand.
 411	Again imagination blazed,
 412	The contact of the foot I raised
 413	Rekindled in my withered heart
 414	The fires of passion and its smart--
 415	Away! and cease to ring their praise
 416	For ever with thy tattling lyre,
 417	The proud ones are not worth the fire
 418	Of passion they so often raise.
 419	The words and looks of charmers sweet
 420	Are oft deceptive--like their feet.Where is Oneguine? Half asleep,
 421	Straight from the ball to bed he goes,
 422	Whilst Petersburg from slumber deep
 423	The drum already doth arouse.
 424	The shopman and the pedlar rise
 425	And to the Bourse the cabman plies;
 426	The Okhtenka with pitcher speeds,
 427	Crunching the morning snow she treads;
 428	Morning awakes with joyous sound;
 429	The shutters open; to the skies
 430	In column blue the smoke doth rise;
 431	The German baker looks around
 432	His shop, a night-cap on his head,
 433	And pauses oft to serve out bread.
 434	But turning morning into night,
 435	Tired by the ball's incessant noise,
 436	The votary of vain delight
 437	Sleep in the shadowy couch enjoys,
 438	Late in the afternoon to rise,
 439	When the same life before him lies
 440	Till morn--life uniform but gay,
 441	To-morrow just like yesterday.
 442	But was our friend Eugene content,
 443	Free, in the blossom of his spring,
 444	Amidst successes flattering
 445	And pleasure's daily blandishment,
 446	Or vainly 'mid luxurious fare
 447	Was he in health and void of care?--Even so! His passions soon abated,
 448	Hateful the hollow world became,
 449	Nor long his mind was agitated
 450	By love's inevitable flame.
 451	For treachery had done its worst;
 452	Friendship and friends he likewise curst,
 453	Because he could not gourmandise
 454	Daily beefsteaks and Strasbourg pies
 455	And irrigate them with champagne;
 456	Nor slander viciously could spread
 457	Whene'er he had an aching head;
 458	And, though a plucky scatterbrain,
 459	He finally lost all delight
 460	In bullets, sabres, and in fight.His malady, whose cause I ween
 461	It now to investigate is time,
 462	Was nothing but the British spleen
 463	Transported to our Russian clime.
 464	It gradually possessed his mind;
 465	Though, God be praised! he ne'er designed
 466	To slay himself with blade or ball,
 467	Indifferent he became to all,
 468	And like Childe Harold gloomily
 469	He to the festival repairs,
 470	Nor boston nor the world's affairs
 471	Nor tender glance nor amorous sigh
 472	Impressed him in the least degree,--
 473	Callous to all he seemed to be.Ye miracles of courtly grace,
 474	He left _you_ first, and I must own
 475	The manners of the highest class
 476	Have latterly vexatious grown;
 477	And though perchance a lady may
 478	Discourse of Bentham or of Say,
 479	Yet as a rule their talk I call
 480	Harmless, but quite nonsensical.
 481	Then they're so innocent of vice,
 482	So full of piety, correct,
 483	So prudent, and so circumspect
 484	Stately, devoid of prejudice,
 485	So inaccessible to men,
 486	Their looks alone produce the spleen.
 487	And you, my youthful damsels fair,
 488	Whom latterly one often meets
 489	Urging your droshkies swift as air
 490	Along Saint Petersburg's paved streets,
 491	From you too Eugene took to flight,
 492	Abandoning insane delight,
 493	And isolated from all men,
 494	Yawning betook him to a pen.
 495	He thought to write, but labour long
 496	Inspired him with disgust and so
 497	Nought from his pen did ever flow,
 498	And thus he never fell among
 499	That vicious set whom I don't blame--
 500	Because a member I became.Once more to idleness consigned,
 501	He felt the laudable desire
 502	From mere vacuity of mind
 503	The wit of others to acquire.
 504	A case of books he doth obtain--
 505	He reads at random, reads in vain.
 506	This nonsense, that dishonest seems,
 507	This wicked, that absurd he deems,
 508	All are constrained and fetters bear,
 509	Antiquity no pleasure gave,
 510	The moderns of the ancients rave--
 511	Books he abandoned like the fair,
 512	His book-shelf instantly doth drape
 513	With taffety instead of crape.Having abjured the haunts of men,
 514	Like him renouncing vanity,
 515	His friendship I acquired just then;
 516	His character attracted me.
 517	An innate love of meditation,
 518	Original imagination,
 519	And cool sagacious mind he had:
 520	I was incensed and he was sad.
 521	Both were of passion satiate
 522	And both of dull existence tired,
 523	Extinct the flame which once had fired;
 524	Both were expectant of the hate
 525	With which blind Fortune oft betrays
 526	The very morning of our days.He who hath lived and living, thinks,
 527	Must e'en despise his kind at last;
 528	He who hath suffered ofttimes shrinks
 529	From shades of the relentless past.
 530	No fond illusions live to soothe,
 531	But memory like a serpent's tooth
 532	With late repentance gnaws and stings.
 533	All this in many cases brings
 534	A charm with it in conversation.
 535	Oneguine's speeches I abhorred
 536	At first, but soon became inured
 537	To the sarcastic observation,
 538	To witticisms and taunts half-vicious
 539	And gloomy epigrams malicious.How oft, when on a summer night
 540	Transparent o'er the Neva beamed
 541	The firmament in mellow light,
 542	And when the watery mirror gleamed
 543	No more with pale Diana's rays,
 544	We called to mind our youthful days--
 545	The days of love and of romance!
 546	Then would we muse as in a trance,
 547	Impressionable for an hour,
 548	And breathe the balmy breath of night;
 549	And like the prisoner's our delight
 550	Who for the greenwood quits his tower,
 551	As on the rapid wings of thought
 552	The early days of life we sought.
 553	Absorbed in melancholy mood
 554	And o'er the granite coping bent,
 555	Oneguine meditative stood,
 556	E'en as the poet says he leant.
 557	'Tis silent all! Alone the cries
 558	Of the night sentinels arise
 559	And from the Millionaya afar
 560	The sudden rattling of a car.
 561	Lo! on the sleeping river borne,
 562	A boat with splashing oar floats by,
 563	And now we hear delightedly
 564	A jolly song and distant horn;
 565	But sweeter in a midnight dream
 566	Torquato Tasso's strains I deem.
 567	Ye billows of blue Hadria's sea,
 568	O Brenta, once more we shall meet
 569	And, inspiration firing me,
 570	Your magic voices I shall greet,
 571	Whose tones Apollo's sons inspire,
 572	And after Albion's proud lyre
 573	Possess my love and sympathy.
 574	The nights of golden Italy
 575	I'll pass beneath the firmament,
 576	Hid in the gondola's dark shade,
 577	Alone with my Venetian maid,
 578	Now talkative, now reticent;
 579	From her my lips shall learn the tongue
 580	Of love which whilom Petrarch sung.
 581	When will my hour of freedom come!
 582	Time, I invoke thee! favouring gales
 583	Awaiting on the shore I roam
 584	And beckon to the passing sails.
 585	Upon the highway of the sea
 586	When shall I wing my passage free
 587	On waves by tempests curdled o'er!
 588	'Tis time to quit this weary shore
 589	So uncongenial to my mind,
 590	To dream upon the sunny strand
 591	Of Africa, ancestral land,
 592	Of dreary Russia left behind,
 593	Wherein I felt love's fatal dart,
 594	Wherein I buried left my heart.
 595	Eugene designed with me to start
 596	And visit many a foreign clime,
 597	But Fortune cast our lots apart
 598	For a protracted space of time.
 599	Just at that time his father died,
 600	And soon Oneguine's door beside
 601	Of creditors a hungry rout
 602	Their claims and explanations shout.
 603	But Eugene, hating litigation
 604	And with his lot in life content,
 605	To a surrender gave consent,
 606	Seeing in this no deprivation,
 607	Or counting on his uncle's death
 608	And what the old man might bequeath.And in reality one day
 609	The steward sent a note to tell
 610	How sick to death his uncle lay
 611	And wished to say to him farewell.
 612	Having this mournful document
 613	Perused, Eugene in postchaise went
 614	And hastened to his uncle's side,
 615	But in his heart dissatisfied,
 616	Having for money's sake alone
 617	Sorrow to counterfeit and wail--
 618	Thus we began our little tale--
 619	But, to his uncle's mansion flown,
 620	He found him on the table laid,
 621	A due which must to earth be paid.The courtyard full of serfs he sees,
 622	And from the country all around
 623	Had come both friends and enemies--
 624	Funeral amateurs abound!
 625	The body they consigned to rest,
 626	And then made merry pope and guest,
 627	With serious air then went away
 628	As men who much had done that day.
 629	Lo! my Oneguine rural lord!
 630	Of mines and meadows, woods and lakes,
 631	He now a full possession takes,
 632	He who economy abhorred,
 633	Delighted much his former ways
 634	To vary for a few brief days.For two whole days it seemed a change
 635	To wander through the meadows still,
 636	The cool dark oaken grove to range,
 637	To listen to the rippling rill.
 638	But on the third of grove and mead
 639	He took no more the slightest heed;
 640	They made him feel inclined to doze;
 641	And the conviction soon arose,
 642	Ennui can in the country dwell
 643	Though without palaces and streets,
 644	Cards, balls, routs, poetry or fetes;
 645	On him spleen mounted sentinel
 646	And like his shadow dogged his life,
 647	Or better,--like a faithful wife.I was for calm existence made,
 648	For rural solitude and dreams,
 649	My lyre sings sweeter in the shade
 650	And more imagination teems.
 651	On innocent delights I dote,
 652	Upon my lake I love to float,
 653	For law I _far niente_ take
 654	And every morning I awake
 655	The child of sloth and liberty.
 656	I slumber much, a little read,
 657	Of fleeting glory take no heed.
 658	In former years thus did not I
 659	In idleness and tranquil joy
 660	The happiest days of life employ?Love, flowers, the country, idleness
 661	And fields my joys have ever been;
 662	I like the difference to express
 663	Between myself and my Eugene,
 664	Lest the malicious reader or
 665	Some one or other editor
 666	Of keen sarcastic intellect
 667	Herein my portrait should detect,
 668	And impiously should declare,
 669	To sketch myself that I have tried
 670	Like Byron, bard of scorn and pride,
 671	As if impossible it were
 672	To write of any other elf
 673	Than one's own fascinating self.Here I remark all poets are
 674	Love to idealize inclined;
 675	I have dreamed many a vision fair
 676	And the recesses of my mind
 677	Retained the image, though short-lived,
 678	Which afterwards the muse revived.
 679	Thus carelessly I once portrayed
 680	Mine own ideal, the mountain maid,
 681	The captives of the Salguir's shore.
 682	But now a question in this wise
 683	Oft upon friendly lips doth rise:
 684	Whom doth thy plaintive Muse adore?
 685	To whom amongst the jealous throng
 686	Of maids dost thou inscribe thy song?
 687	Whose glance reflecting inspiration
 688	With tenderness hath recognized
 689	Thy meditative incantation--
 690	Whom hath thy strain immortalized?
 691	None, be my witness Heaven above!
 692	The malady of hopeless love
 693	I have endured without respite.
 694	Happy who thereto can unite
 695	Poetic transport. They impart
 696	A double force unto their song
 697	Who following Petrarch move along
 698	And ease the tortures of the heart--
 699	Perchance they laurels also cull--
 700	But I, in love, was mute and dull.The Muse appeared, when love passed by
 701	And my dark soul to light was brought;
 702	Free, I renewed the idolatry
 703	Of harmony enshrining thought.
 704	I write, and anguish flies away,
 705	Nor doth my absent pen portray
 706	Around my stanzas incomplete
 707	Young ladies' faces and their feet.
 708	Extinguished ashes do not blaze--
 709	I mourn, but tears I cannot shed--
 710	Soon, of the tempest which hath fled
 711	Time will the ravages efface--
 712	When that time comes, a poem I'll strive
 713	To write in cantos twenty-five.I've thought well o'er the general plan,
 714	The hero's name too in advance,
 715	Meantime I'll finish whilst I can
 716	Canto the First of this romance.
 717	I've scanned it with a jealous eye,
 718	Discovered much absurdity,
 719	But will not modify a tittle--
 720	I owe the censorship a little.
 721	For journalistic deglutition
 722	I yield the fruit of work severe.
 723	Go, on the Neva's bank appear,
 724	My very latest composition!
 725	Enjoy the meed which Fame bestows--
 726	Misunderstanding, words and blows.
 727	The PoetCanto The SecondThe village wherein yawned Eugene
 728	Was a delightful little spot,
 729	There friends of pure delight had been
 730	Grateful to Heaven for their lot.
 731	The lonely mansion-house to screen
 732	From gales a hill behind was seen;
 733	Before it ran a stream. Behold!
 734	Afar, where clothed in green and gold
 735	Meadows and cornfields are displayed,
 736	Villages in the distance show
 737	And herds of oxen wandering low;
 738	Whilst nearer, sunk in deeper shade,
 739	A thick immense neglected grove
 740	Extended--haunt which Dryads love.
 741	'Twas built, the venerable pile,
 742	As lordly mansions ought to be,
 743	In solid, unpretentious style,
 744	The style of wise antiquity.
 745	Lofty the chambers one and all,
 746	Silk tapestry upon the wall,
 747	Imperial portraits hang around
 748	And stoves of various shapes abound.
 749	All this I know is out of date,
 750	I cannot tell the reason why,
 751	But Eugene, incontestably,
 752	The matter did not agitate,
 753	Because he yawned at the bare view
 754	Of drawing-rooms or old or new.
 755	He took the room wherein the old
 756	Man--forty years long in this wise--
 757	His housekeeper was wont to scold,
 758	Look through the window and kill flies.
 759	'Twas plain--an oaken floor ye scan,
 760	Two cupboards, table, soft divan,
 761	And not a speck of dirt descried.
 762	Oneguine oped the cupboards wide.
 763	In one he doth accounts behold,
 764	Here bottles stand in close array,
 765	There jars of cider block the way,
 766	An almanac but eight years old.
 767	His uncle, busy man indeed,
 768	No other book had time to read.
 769	Alone amid possessions great,
 770	Eugene at first began to dream,
 771	If but to lighten Time's dull rate,
 772	Of many an economic scheme;
 773	This anchorite amid his waste
 774	The ancient _barshtchina_ replaced
 775	By an _obrok's_ indulgent rate:
 776	The peasant blessed his happy fate.
 777	But this a heinous crime appeared
 778	Unto his neighbour, man of thrift,
 779	Who secretly denounced the gift,
 780	And many another slily sneered;
 781	And all with one accord agreed,
 782	He was a dangerous fool indeed.
 783	All visited him at first, of course;
 784	But since to the backdoor they led
 785	Most usually a Cossack horse
 786	Upon the Don's broad pastures bred
 787	If they but heard domestic loads
 788	Come rumbling up the neighbouring roads,
 789	Most by this circumstance offended
 790	All overtures of friendship ended.
 791	"Oh! what a fool our neighbour is!
 792	He's a freemason, so we think.
 793	Alone he doth his claret drink,
 794	A lady's hand doth never kiss.
 795	'Tis _yes! no!_ never _madam! sir!_"
 796	This was his social character.
 797	Into the district then to boot
 798	A new proprietor arrived,
 799	From whose analysis minute
 800	The neighbourhood fresh sport derived.
 801	Vladimir Lenski was his name,
 802	From Gottingen inspired he came,
 803	A worshipper of Kant, a bard,
 804	A young and handsome galliard.
 805	He brought from mystic Germany
 806	The fruits of learning and combined
 807	A fiery and eccentric mind,
 808	Idolatry of liberty,
 809	A wild enthusiastic tongue,
 810	Black curls which to his shoulders hung.
 811	The pervert world with icy chill
 812	Had not yet withered his young breast.
 813	His heart reciprocated still
 814	When Friendship smiled or Love caressed.
 815	He was a dear delightful fool--
 816	A nursling yet for Hope to school.
 817	The riot of the world and glare
 818	Still sovereigns of his spirit were,
 819	And by a sweet delusion he
 820	Would soothe the doubtings of his soul,
 821	He deemed of human life the goal
 822	To be a charming mystery:
 823	He racked his brains to find its clue
 824	And marvels deemed he thus should view.
 825	This he believed: a kindred spirit
 826	Impelled to union with his own
 827	Lay languishing both day and night--
 828	Waiting his coming--his alone!
 829	He deemed his friends but longed to make
 830	Great sacrifices for his sake!
 831	That a friend's arm in every case
 832	Felled a calumniator base!
 833	That chosen heroes consecrate,
 834	Friends of the sons of every land,
 835	Exist--that their immortal band
 836	Shall surely, be it soon or late,
 837	Pour on this orb a dazzling light
 838	And bless mankind with full delight.
 839	Compassion now or wrath inspires
 840	And now philanthropy his soul,
 841	And now his youthful heart desires
 842	The path which leads to glory's goal.
 843	His harp beneath that sky had rung
 844	Where sometime Goethe, Schiller sung,
 845	And at the altar of their fame
 846	He kindled his poetic flame.
 847	But from the Muses' loftiest height
 848	The gifted songster never swerved,
 849	But proudly in his song preserved
 850	An ever transcendental flight;
 851	His transports were quite maidenly,
 852	Charming with grave simplicity.He sang of love--to love a slave.
 853	His ditties were as pure and bright
 854	As thoughts which gentle maidens have,
 855	As a babe's slumber, or the light
 856	Of the moon in the tranquil skies,
 857	Goddess of lovers' tender sighs.
 858	He sang of separation grim,
 859	Of what not, and of distant dim,
 860	Of roses to romancers dear;
 861	To foreign lands he would allude,
 862	Where long time he in solitude
 863	Had let fall many a bitter tear:
 864	He sang of life's fresh colours stained
 865	Before he eighteen years attained.Since Eugene in that solitude
 866	Gifts such as these alone could prize,
 867	A scant attendance Lenski showed
 868	At neighbouring hospitalities.
 869	He shunned those parties boisterous;
 870	The conversation tedious
 871	About the crop of hay, the wine,
 872	The kennel or a kindred line,
 873	Was certainly not erudite
 874	Nor sparkled with poetic fire,
 875	Nor wit, nor did the same inspire
 876	A sense of social delight,
 877	But still more stupid did appear
 878	The gossip of their ladies fair.Handsome and rich, the neighbourhood
 879	Lenski as a good match received,--
 880	Such is the country custom good;
 881	All mothers their sweet girls believed
 882	Suitable for this semi-Russian.
 883	He enters: rapidly discussion
 884	Shifts, tacks about, until they prate
 885	The sorrows of a single state.
 886	Perchance where Dunia pours out tea
 887	The young proprietor we find;
 888	To Dunia then they whisper: Mind!
 889	And a guitar produced we see,
 890	And Heavens! warbled forth we hear:
 891	_Come to my golden palace, dear_!
 892	But Lenski, having no desire
 893	Vows matrimonial to break,
 894	With our Oneguine doth aspire
 895	Acquaintance instantly to make.
 896	They met. Earth, water, prose and verse,
 897	Or ice and flame, are not diverse
 898	If they were similar in aught.
 899	At first such contradictions wrought
 900	Mutual repulsion and ennui,
 901	But grown familiar side by side
 902	On horseback every day they ride--
 903	Inseparable soon they be.
 904	Thus oft--this I myself confess--
 905	Men become friends from idleness.But even thus not now-a-days!
 906	In spite of common sense we're wont
 907	As cyphers others to appraise,
 908	Ourselves as unities to count;
 909	And like Napoleons each of us
 910	A million bipeds reckons thus
 911	One instrument for his own use--
 912	Feeling is silly, dangerous.
 913	Eugene, more tolerant than this
 914	(Though certainly mankind he knew
 915	And usually despised it too),
 916	Exceptionless as no rule is,
 917	A few of different temper deemed,
 918	Feeling in others much esteemed.With smiling face he Lenski hears;
 919	The poet's fervid conversation
 920	And judgment which unsteady veers
 921	And eye which gleams with inspiration--
 922	All this was novel to Eugene.
 923	The cold reply with gloomy mien
 924	He oft upon his lips would curb,
 925	Thinking: 'tis foolish to disturb
 926	This evanescent boyish bliss.
 927	Time without me will lessons give,
 928	So meantime let him joyous live
 929	And deem the world perfection is!
 930	Forgive the fever youth inspires,
 931	And youthful madness, youthful fires.The gulf between them was so vast,
 932	Debate commanded ample food--
 933	The laws of generations past,
 934	The fruits of science, evil, good,
 935	The prejudices all men have,
 936	The fatal secrets of the grave,
 937	And life and fate in turn selected
 938	Were to analysis subjected.
 939	The fervid poet would recite,
 940	Carried away by ecstasy,
 941	Fragments of northern poetry,
 942	Whilst Eugene condescending quite,
 943	Though scarcely following what was said,
 944	Attentive listened to the lad.But more the passions occupy
 945	The converse of our hermits twain,
 946	And, heaving a regretful sigh,
 947	An exile from their troublous reign,
 948	Eugene would speak regarding these.
 949	Thrice happy who their agonies
 950	Hath suffered but indifferent grown,
 951	Still happier he who ne'er hath known!
 952	By absence who hath chilled his love,
 953	His hate by slander, and who spends
 954	Existence without wife or friends,
 955	Whom jealous transport cannot move,
 956	And who the rent-roll of his race
 957	Ne'er trusted to the treacherous ace.When, wise at length, we seek repose
 958	Beneath the flag of Quietude,
 959	When Passion's fire no longer glows
 960	And when her violence reviewed--
 961	Each gust of temper, silly word,
 962	Seems so unnatural and absurd:
 963	Reduced with effort unto sense,
 964	We hear with interest intense
 965	The accents wild of other's woes,
 966	They stir the heart as heretofore.
 967	So ancient warriors, battles o'er,
 968	A curious interest disclose
 969	In yarns of youthful troopers gay,
 970	Lost in the hamlet far away.And in addition youth is flame
 971	And cannot anything conceal,
 972	Is ever ready to proclaim
 973	The love, hate, sorrow, joy, we feel.
 974	Deeming himself a veteran scarred
 975	In love's campaigns Oneguine heard
 976	With quite a lachrymose expression
 977	The youthful poet's fond confession.
 978	He with an innocence extreme
 979	His inner consciousness laid bare,
 980	And Eugene soon discovered there
 981	The story of his young love's dream,
 982	Where plentifully feelings flow
 983	Which we experienced long ago.Alas! he loved as in our times
 984	Men love no more, as only the
 985	Mad spirit of the man who rhymes
 986	Is still condemned in love to be;
 987	One image occupied his mind,
 988	Constant affection intertwined
 989	And an habitual sense of pain;
 990	And distance interposed in vain,
 991	Nor years of separation all
 992	Nor homage which the Muse demands
 993	Nor beauties of far distant lands
 994	Nor study, banquet, rout nor ball
 995	His constant soul could ever tire,
 996	Which glowed with virginal desire.When but a boy he Olga loved
 997	Unknown as yet the aching heart,
 998	He witnessed tenderly and moved
 999	Her girlish gaiety and sport.
1000	Beneath the sheltering oak tree's shade
1001	He with his little maiden played,
1002	Whilst the fond parents, friends thro' life,
1003	Dreamed in the future man and wife.
1004	And full of innocent delight,
1005	As in a thicket's humble shade,
1006	Beneath her parents' eyes the maid
1007	Grew like a lily pure and white,
1008	Unseen in thick and tangled grass
1009	By bee and butterfly which pass.'Twas she who first within his breast
1010	Poetic transport did infuse,
1011	And thoughts of Olga first impressed
1012	A mournful temper on his Muse.
1013	Farewell! thou golden days of love!
1014	'Twas then he loved the tangled grove
1015	And solitude and calm delight,
1016	The moon, the stars, and shining night--
1017	The moon, the lamp of heaven above,
1018	To whom we used to consecrate
1019	A promenade in twilight late
1020	With tears which secret sufferers love--
1021	But now in her effulgence pale
1022	A substitute for lamps we hail!Obedient she had ever been
1023	And modest, cheerful as the morn,
1024	As a poetic life serene,
1025	Sweet as the kiss of lovers sworn.
1026	Her eyes were of cerulean blue,
1027	Her locks were of a golden hue,
1028	Her movements, voice and figure slight,
1029	All about Olga--to a light
1030	Romance of love I pray refer,
1031	You'll find her portrait there, I vouch;
1032	I formerly admired her much
1033	But finally grew bored by her.
1034	But with her elder sister I
1035	Must now my stanzas occupy.Tattiana was her appellation.
1036	We are the first who such a name
1037	In pages of a love narration
1038	With such a perversity proclaim.
1039	But wherefore not?--'Tis pleasant, nice,
1040	Euphonious, though I know a spice
1041	It carries of antiquity
1042	And of the attic. Honestly,
1043	We must admit but little taste
1044	Doth in us or our names appear,
1045	And education runs to waste,
1046	Endowing us from out her store
1047	With affectation,--nothing more.
1048	And so Tattiana was her name,
1049	Nor by her sister's brilliancy
1050	Nor by her beauty she became
1051	The cynosure of every eye.
1052	Shy, silent did the maid appear
1053	As in the timid forest deer,
1054	Even beneath her parents' roof
1055	Stood as estranged from all aloof,
1056	Nearest and dearest knew not how
1057	To fawn upon and love express;
1058	A child devoid of childishness
1059	To romp and play she ne'er would go:
1060	Oft staring through the window pane
1061	Would she in silence long remain.Contemplativeness, her delight,
1062	E'en from her cradle's earliest dream,
1063	Adorned with many a vision bright
1064	Of rural life the sluggish stream;
1065	Ne'er touched her fingers indolent
1066	The needle nor, o'er framework bent,
1067	Would she the canvas tight enrich
1068	With gay design and silken stitch.
1069	Desire to rule ye may observe
1070	When the obedient doll in sport
1071	An infant maiden doth exhort
1072	Polite demeanour to preserve,
1073	Gravely repeating to another
1074	Recent instructions of its mother.But Tania ne'er displayed a passion
1075	For dolls, e'en from her earliest years,
1076	And gossip of the town and fashion
1077	She ne'er repeated unto hers.
1078	Strange unto her each childish game,
1079	But when the winter season came
1080	And dark and drear the evenings were,
1081	Terrible tales she loved to hear.
1082	And when for Olga nurse arrayed
1083	In the broad meadow a gay rout,
1084	All the young people round about,
1085	At prisoner's base she never played.
1086	Their noisy laugh her soul annoyed,
1087	Their giddy sports she ne'er enjoyed.She loved upon the balcony
1088	To anticipate the break of day,
1089	When on the pallid eastern sky
1090	The starry beacons fade away,
1091	The horizon luminous doth grow,
1092	Morning's forerunners, breezes blow
1093	And gradually day unfolds.
1094	In winter, when Night longer holds
1095	A hemisphere beneath her sway,
1096	Longer the East inert reclines
1097	Beneath the moon which dimly shines,
1098	And calmly sleeps the hours away,
1099	At the same hour she oped her eyes
1100	And would by candlelight arise.Romances pleased her from the first,
1101	Her all in all did constitute;
1102	In love adventures she was versed,
1103	Rousseau and Richardson to boot.
1104	Not a bad fellow was her father
1105	Though superannuated rather;
1106	In books he saw nought to condemn
1107	But, as he never opened them,
1108	Viewed them with not a little scorn,
1109	And gave himself but little pain
1110	His daughter's book to ascertain
1111	Which 'neath her pillow lay till morn.
1112	His wife was also mad upon
1113	The works of Mr. Richardson.She was thus fond of Richardson
1114	Not that she had his works perused,
1115	Or that adoring Grandison
1116	That rascal Lovelace she abused;
1117	But that Princess Pauline of old,
1118	Her Moscow cousin, often told
1119	The tale of these romantic men;
1120	Her husband was a bridegroom then,
1121	And she despite herself would waste
1122	Sighs on another than her lord
1123	Whose qualities appeared to afford
1124	More satisfaction to her taste.
1125	Her Grandison was in the Guard,
1126	A noted fop who gambled hard.Like his, her dress was always nice,
1127	The height of fashion, fitting tight,
1128	But contrary to her advice
1129	The girl in marriage they unite.
1130	Then, her distraction to allay,
1131	The bridegroom sage without delay
1132	Removed her to his country seat,
1133	Where God alone knows whom she met.
1134	She struggled hard at first thus pent,
1135	Night separated from her spouse,
1136	Then became busy with the house,
1137	First reconciled and then content;
1138	Habit was given us in distress
1139	By Heaven in lieu of happiness.Habit alleviates the grief
1140	Inseparable from our lot;
1141	This great discovery relief
1142	And consolation soon begot.
1143	And then she soon 'twixt work and leisure
1144	Found out the secret how at pleasure
1145	To dominate her worthy lord,
1146	And harmony was soon restored.
1147	The workpeople she superintended,
1148	Mushrooms for winter salted down,
1149	Kept the accounts, shaved many a crown,
1150	The bath on Saturdays attended,
1151	When angry beat her maids, I grieve,
1152	And all without her husband's leave.
1153	In her friends' albums, time had been,
1154	With blood instead of ink she scrawled,
1155	Baptized Prascovia Pauline,
1156	And in her conversation drawled.
1157	She wore her corset tightly bound,
1158	The Russian N with nasal sound
1159	She would pronounce _a la Francaise_;
1160	But soon she altered all her ways,
1161	Corset and album and Pauline,
1162	Her sentimental verses all,
1163	She soon forgot, began to call
1164	Akulka who was once Celine,
1165	And had with waddling in the end
1166	Her caps and night-dresses to mend.As for her spouse he loved her dearly,
1167	In her affairs ne'er interfered,
1168	Entrusted all to her sincerely,
1169	In dressing-gown at meals appeared.
1170	Existence calmly sped along,
1171	And oft at eventide a throng
1172	Of friends unceremonious would
1173	Assemble from the neighbourhood:
1174	They growl a bit--they scandalise--
1175	They crack a feeble joke and smile--
1176	Thus the time passes and meanwhile
1177	Olga the tea must supervise--
1178	'Tis time for supper, now for bed,
1179	And soon the friendly troop hath fled.They in a peaceful life preserved
1180	Customs by ages sanctified,
1181	Strictly the Carnival observed,
1182	Ate Russian pancakes at Shrovetide,
1183	Twice in the year to fast were bound,
1184	Of whirligigs were very fond,
1185	Of Christmas carols, song and dance;
1186	When people with long countenance
1187	On Trinity Sunday yawned at prayer,
1188	Three tears they dropt with humble mein
1189	Upon a bunch of lovage green;
1190	_Kvass_ needful was to them as air;
1191	On guests their servants used to wait
1192	By rank as settled by the State.
1193	Thus age approached, the common doom,
1194	And death before the husband wide
1195	Opened the portals of the tomb
1196	And a new diadem supplied.
1197	Just before dinner-time he slept,
1198	By neighbouring families bewept,
1199	By children and by faithful wife
1200	With deeper woe than others' grief.
1201	He was an honest gentleman,
1202	And where at last his bones repose
1203	The epitaph on marble shows:
1204	_Demetrius Larine, sinful man,
1205	Servant of God and brigadier,
1206	Enjoyeth peaceful slumber here_.
1207	To his Penates now returned,
1208	Vladimir Lenski visited
1209	His neighbour's lowly tomb and mourned
1210	Above the ashes of the dead.
1211	There long time sad at heart he stayed:
1212	"Poor Yorick," mournfully he said,
1213	"How often in thine arms I lay;
1214	How with thy medal I would play,
1215	The Medal Otchakoff conferred!
1216	To me he would his Olga give,
1217	Would whisper: shall I so long live?"--
1218	And by a genuine sorrow stirred,
1219	Lenski his pencil-case took out
1220	And an elegiac poem wrote.
1221	Likewise an epitaph with tears
1222	He writes upon his parents' tomb,
1223	And thus ancestral dust reveres.
1224	Oh! on the fields of life how bloom
1225	Harvests of souls unceasingly
1226	By Providence's dark decree!
1227	They blossom, ripen and they fall
1228	And others rise ephemeral!
1229	Thus our light race grows up and lives,
1230	A moment effervescing stirs,
1231	Then seeks ancestral sepulchres,
1232	The appointed hour arrives, arrives!
1233	And our successors soon shall drive
1234	Us from the world wherein we live.Meantime, drink deeply of the flow
1235	Of frivolous existence, friends;
1236	Its insignificance I know
1237	And care but little for its ends.
1238	To dreams I long have closed mine eyes,
1239	Yet sometimes banished hopes will rise
1240	And agitate my heart again;
1241	And thus it is 'twould cause me pain
1242	Without the faintest trace to leave
1243	This world. I do not praise desire,
1244	Yet still apparently aspire
1245	My mournful fate in verse to weave,
1246	That like a friendly voice its tone
1247	Rescue me from oblivion.Perchance some heart 'twill agitate,
1248	And then the stanzas of my theme
1249	Will not, preserved by kindly Fate,
1250	Perish absorbed by Lethe's stream.
1251	Then it may be, O flattering tale,
1252	Some future ignoramus shall
1253	My famous portrait indicate
1254	And cry: he was a poet great!
1255	My gratitude do not disdain,
1256	Admirer of the peaceful Muse,
1257	Whose memory doth not refuse
1258	My light productions to retain,
1259	Whose hands indulgently caress
1260	The bays of age and helplessness.
1261	The Country DamselCanto The Third"Whither away? Deuce take the bard!"--
1262	"Good-bye, Oneguine, I must go."--
1263	"I won't detain you; but 'tis hard
1264	To guess how you the eve pull through."--
1265	"At Larina's."--"Hem, that is queer!
1266	Pray is it not a tough affair
1267	Thus to assassinate the eve?"--
1268	"Not at all."--"That I can't conceive!
1269	'Tis something of this sort I deem.
1270	In the first place, say, am I right?
1271	A Russian household simple quite,
1272	Who welcome guests with zeal extreme,
1273	Preserves and an eternal prattle
1274	About the rain and flax and cattle."--
1275	"No misery I see in that"--
1276	"Boredom, my friend, behold the ill--"
1277	"Your fashionable world I hate,
1278	Domestic life attracts me still,
1279	Where--"--"What! another eclogue spin?
1280	For God's sake, Lenski, don't begin!
1281	What! really going? 'Tis too bad!
1282	But Lenski, I should be so glad
1283	Would you to me this Phyllis show,
1284	Fair source of every fine idea,
1285	Verses and tears et cetera.
1286	Present me."--"You are joking."--"No."--
1287	"Delighted."--"When?"--"This very night.
1288	They will receive us with delight."
1289	Whilst homeward by the nearest route
1290	Our heroes at full gallop sped,
1291	Can we not stealthily make out
1292	What they in conversation said?--
1293	"How now, Oneguine, yawning still?"--
1294	"'Tis habit, Lenski."--"Is your ill
1295	More troublesome than usual?"--"No!
1296	How dark the night is getting though!
1297	Hallo, Andriushka, onward race!
1298	The drive becomes monotonous--
1299	Well! Larina appears to us
1300	An ancient lady full of grace.--
1301	That bilberry wine, I'm sore afraid,
1302	The deuce with my inside has played."
1303	"Say, of the two which was Tattiana?"
1304	"She who with melancholy face
1305	And silent as the maid Svetlana
1306	Hard by the window took her place."--
1307	"The younger, you're in love with her!"
1308	"Well!"--"I the elder should prefer,
1309	Were I like you a bard by trade--
1310	In Olga's face no life's displayed.
1311	'Tis a Madonna of Vandyk,
1312	An oval countenance and pink,
1313	Yon silly moon upon the brink
1314	Of the horizon she is like!"--
1315	Vladimir something curtly said
1316	Nor further comment that night made.
1317	Meantime Oneguine's apparition
1318	At Larina's abode produced
1319	Quite a sensation; the position
1320	To all good neighbours' sport conduced.
1321	Endless conjectures all propound
1322	And secretly their views expound.
1323	What jokes and guesses now abound,
1324	A beau is for Tattiana found!
1325	In fact, some people were assured
1326	The wedding-day had been arranged,
1327	But the date subsequently changed
1328	Till proper rings could be procured.
1329	On Lenski's matrimonial fate
1330	They long ago had held debate.
1331	Of course Tattiana was annoyed
1332	By such allusions scandalous,
1333	Yet was her inmost soul o'erjoyed
1334	With satisfaction marvellous,
1335	As in her heart the thought sank home,
1336	I am in love, my hour hath come!
1337	Thus in the earth the seed expands
1338	Obedient to warm Spring's commands.
1339	Long time her young imagination
1340	By indolence and languor fired
1341	The fated nutriment desired;
1342	And long internal agitation
1343	Had filled her youthful breast with gloom,
1344	She waited for--I don't know whom!
1345	The fatal hour had come at last--
1346	She oped her eyes and cried: 'tis he!
1347	Alas! for now before her passed
1348	The same warm vision constantly;
1349	Now all things round about repeat
1350	Ceaselessly to the maiden sweet
1351	His name: the tenderness of home
1352	Tiresome unto her hath become
1353	And the kind-hearted servitors:
1354	Immersed in melancholy thought,
1355	She hears of conversation nought
1356	And hated casual visitors,
1357	Their coming which no man expects,
1358	And stay whose length none recollects.
1359	Now with what eager interest
1360	She the delicious novel reads,
1361	With what avidity and zest
1362	She drinks in those seductive deeds!
1363	All the creations which below
1364	From happy inspiration flow,
1365	The swain of Julia Wolmar,
1366	Malek Adel and De Linar,
1367	Werther, rebellious martyr bold,
1368	And that unrivalled paragon,
1369	The sleep-compelling Grandison,
1370	Our tender dreamer had enrolled
1371	A single being: 'twas in fine
1372	No other than Oneguine mine.
1373	Dreaming herself the heroine
1374	Of the romances she preferred,
1375	Clarissa, Julia, Delphine,--
1376	Tattiana through the forest erred,
1377	And the bad book accompanies.
1378	Upon those pages she descries
1379	Her passion's faithful counterpart,
1380	Fruit of the yearnings of the heart.
1381	She heaves a sigh and deep intent
1382	On raptures, sorrows not her own,
1383	She murmurs in an undertone
1384	A letter for her hero meant:
1385	That hero, though his merit shone,
1386	Was certainly no Grandison.
1387	Alas! my friends, the years flit by
1388	And after them at headlong pace
1389	The evanescent fashions fly
1390	In motley and amusing chase.
1391	The world is ever altering!
1392	Farthingales, patches, were the thing,
1393	And courtier, fop, and usurer
1394	Would once in powdered wig appear;
1395	Time was, the poet's tender quill
1396	In hopes of everlasting fame
1397	A finished madrigal would frame
1398	Or couplets more ingenious still;
1399	Time was, a valiant general might
1400	Serve who could neither read nor write.Time was, in style magniloquent
1401	Authors replete with sacred fire
1402	Their heroes used to represent
1403	All that perfection could desire;
1404	Ever by adverse fate oppressed,
1405	Their idols they were wont to invest
1406	With intellect, a taste refined,
1407	And handsome countenance combined,
1408	A heart wherein pure passion burnt;
1409	The excited hero in a trice
1410	Was ready for self-sacrifice,
1411	And in the final tome we learnt,
1412	Vice had due punishment awarded,
1413	Virtue was with a bride rewarded.But now our minds are mystified
1414	And Virtue acts as a narcotic,
1415	Vice in romance is glorified
1416	And triumphs in career erotic.
1417	The monsters of the British Muse
1418	Deprive our schoolgirls of repose,
1419	The idols of their adoration
1420	A Vampire fond of meditation,
1421	Or Melmoth, gloomy wanderer he,
1422	The Eternal Jew or the Corsair
1423	Or the mysterious Sbogar.
1424	Byron's capricious phantasy
1425	Could in romantic mantle drape
1426	E'en hopeless egoism's dark shape.
1427	My friends, what means this odd digression?
1428	May be that I by heaven's decrees
1429	Shall abdicate the bard's profession,
1430	And shall adopt some new caprice.
1431	Thus having braved Apollo's rage
1432	With humble prose I'll fill my page
1433	And a romance in ancient style
1434	Shall my declining years beguile;
1435	Nor shall my pen paint terribly
1436	The torment born of crime unseen,
1437	But shall depict the touching scene
1438	Of Russian domesticity;
1439	I will descant on love's sweet dream,
1440	The olden time shall be my theme.Old people's simple conversations
1441	My unpretending page shall fill,
1442	Their offspring's innocent flirtations
1443	By the old lime-tree or the rill,
1444	Their Jealousy and separation
1445	And tears of reconciliation:
1446	Fresh cause of quarrel then I'll find,
1447	But finally in wedlock bind.
1448	The passionate speeches I'll repeat,
1449	Accents of rapture or despair
1450	I uttered to my lady fair
1451	Long ago, prostrate at her feet.
1452	Then they came easily enow,
1453	My tongue is somewhat rusty now.Tattiana! sweet Tattiana, see!
1454	What bitter tears with thee I shed!
1455	Thou hast resigned thy destiny
1456	Unto a ruthless tyrant dread.
1457	Thou'lt suffer, dearest, but before,
1458	Hope with her fascinating power
1459	To dire contentment shall give birth
1460	And thou shalt taste the joys of earth.
1461	Thou'lt quaff love's sweet envenomed stream,
1462	Fantastic images shall swarm
1463	In thy imagination warm,
1464	Of happy meetings thou shalt dream,
1465	And wheresoe'er thy footsteps err,
1466	Confront thy fated torturer!Love's pangs Tattiana agonize.
1467	She seeks the garden in her need--
1468	Sudden she stops, casts down her eyes
1469	And cares not farther to proceed;
1470	Her bosom heaves whilst crimson hues
1471	With sudden flush her cheeks suffuse,
1472	Barely to draw her breath she seems,
1473	Her eye with fire unwonted gleams.
1474	And now 'tis night, the guardian moon
1475	Sails her allotted course on high,
1476	And from the misty woodland nigh
1477	The nightingale trills forth her tune;
1478	Restless Tattiana sleepless lay
1479	And thus unto her nurse did say:"Nurse, 'tis so close I cannot rest.
1480	Open the window--sit by me."
1481	"What ails thee, dear?"--"I feel depressed.
1482	Relate some ancient history."
1483	"But which, my dear?--In days of yore
1484	Within my memory I bore
1485	Many an ancient legend which
1486	In monsters and fair dames was rich;
1487	But now my mind is desolate,
1488	What once I knew is clean forgot--
1489	Alas! how wretched now my lot!"
1490	"But tell me, nurse, can you relate
1491	The days which to your youth belong?
1492	Were you in love when you were young?"--"Alack! Tattiana," she replied,
1493	"We never loved in days of old,
1494	My mother-in-law who lately died
1495	Had killed me had the like been told."
1496	"How came you then to wed a man?"--
1497	"Why, as God ordered! My Ivan
1498	Was younger than myself, my light,
1499	For I myself was thirteen quite;
1500	The matchmaker a fortnight sped,
1501	Her suit before my parents pressing:
1502	At last my father gave his blessing,
1503	And bitter tears of fright I shed.
1504	Weeping they loosed my tresses long
1505	And led me off to church with song."
1506	"Then amongst strangers I was left--
1507	But I perceive thou dost not heed--"
1508	"Alas! dear nurse, my heart is cleft,
1509	Mortally sick I am indeed.
1510	Behold, my sobs I scarce restrain--"
1511	"My darling child, thou art in pain.--
1512	The Lord deliver her and save!
1513	Tell me at once what wilt thou have?
1514	I'll sprinkle thee with holy water.--
1515	How thy hands burn!"--"Dear nurse, I'm well.
1516	I am--in love--you know--don't tell!"
1517	"The Lord be with thee, O my daughter!"--
1518	And the old nurse a brief prayer said
1519	And crossed with trembling hand the maid."I am in love," her whispers tell
1520	The aged woman in her woe:
1521	"My heart's delight, thou art not well."--
1522	"I am in love, nurse! leave me now."
1523	Behold! the moon was shining bright
1524	And showed with an uncertain light
1525	Tattiana's beauty, pale with care,
1526	Her tears and her dishevelled hair;
1527	And on the footstool sitting down
1528	Beside our youthful heroine fair,
1529	A kerchief round her silver hair
1530	The aged nurse in ample gown,
1531	Whilst all creation seemed to dream
1532	Enchanted by the moon's pale beam.
1533	But borne in spirit far away
1534	Tattiana gazes on the moon,
1535	And starting suddenly doth say:
1536	"Nurse, leave me. I would be alone.
1537	Pen, paper bring: the table too
1538	Draw near. I soon to sleep shall go--
1539	Good-night." Behold! she is alone!
1540	'Tis silent--on her shines the moon--
1541	Upon her elbow she reclines,
1542	And Eugene ever in her soul
1543	Indites an inconsiderate scroll
1544	Wherein love innocently pines.
1545	Now it is ready to be sent--
1546	For whom, Tattiana, is it meant?I have known beauties cold and raw
1547	As Winter in their purity,
1548	Striking the intellect with awe
1549	By dull insensibility,
1550	And I admired their common sense
1551	And natural benevolence,
1552	But, I acknowledge, from them fled;
1553	For on their brows I trembling read
1554	The inscription o'er the gates of Hell
1555	"Abandon hope for ever here!"
1556	Love to inspire doth woe appear
1557	To such--delightful to repel.
1558	Perchance upon the Neva e'en
1559	Similar dames ye may have seen.
1560	Amid submissive herds of men
1561	Virgins miraculous I see,
1562	Who selfishly unmoved remain
1563	Alike by sighs and flattery.
1564	But what astonished do I find
1565	When harsh demeanour hath consigned
1566	A timid love to banishment?--
1567	On fresh allurements they are bent,
1568	At least by show of sympathy;
1569	At least their accents and their words
1570	Appear attuned to softer chords;
1571	And then with blind credulity
1572	The youthful lover once again
1573	Pursues phantasmagoria vain.Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed?--
1574	Because in singleness of thought
1575	She never of deception dreamed
1576	But trusted the ideal she wrought?--
1577	Because her passion wanted art,
1578	Obeyed the impulses of heart?--
1579	Because she was so innocent,
1580	That Heaven her character had blent
1581	With an imagination wild,
1582	With intellect and strong volition
1583	And a determined disposition,
1584	An ardent heart and yet so mild?--
1585	Doth love's incautiousness in her
1586	So irremissible appear?O ye whom tender love hath pained
1587	Without the ken of parents both,
1588	Whose hearts responsive have remained
1589	To the impressions of our youth,
1590	The all-entrancing joys of love--
1591	Young ladies, if ye ever strove
1592	The mystic lines to tear away
1593	A lover's letter might convey,
1594	Or into bold hands anxiously
1595	Have e'er a precious tress consigned,
1596	Or even, silent and resigned,
1597	When separation's hour drew nigh,
1598	Have felt love's agitated kiss
1599	With tears, confused emotions, bliss,--With unanimity complete,
1600	Condemn not weak Tattiana mine;
1601	Do not cold-bloodedly repeat
1602	The sneers of critics superfine;
1603	And you, O maids immaculate,
1604	Whom vice, if named, doth agitate
1605	E'en as the presence of a snake,
1606	I the same admonition make.
1607	Who knows? with love's consuming flame
1608	Perchance you also soon may burn,
1609	Then to some gallant in your turn
1610	Will be ascribed by treacherous Fame
1611	The triumph of a conquest new.
1612	The God of Love is after you!A coquette loves by calculation,
1613	Tattiana's love was quite sincere,
1614	A love which knew no limitation,
1615	Even as the love of children dear.
1616	She did not think "procrastination
1617	Enhances love in estimation
1618	And thus secures the prey we seek.
1619	His vanity first let us pique
1620	With hope and then perplexity,
1621	Excruciate the heart and late
1622	With jealous fire resuscitate,
1623	Lest jaded with satiety,
1624	The artful prisoner should seek
1625	Incessantly his chains to break."I still a complication view,
1626	My country's honour and repute
1627	Demands that I translate for you
1628	The letter which Tattiana wrote.
1629	At Russ she was by no means clever
1630	And read our newspapers scarce ever,
1631	And in her native language she
1632	Possessed nor ease nor fluency,
1633	So she in French herself expressed.
1634	I cannot help it I declare,
1635	Though hitherto a lady ne'er
1636	In Russ her love made manifest,
1637	And never hath our language proud
1638	In correspondence been allowed.
1639	They wish that ladies should, I hear,
1640	Learn Russian, but the Lord defend!
1641	I can't conceive a little dear
1642	With the "Well-Wisher" in her hand!
1643	I ask, all ye who poets are,
1644	Is it not true? the objects fair,
1645	To whom ye for unnumbered crimes
1646	Had to compose in secret rhymes,
1647	To whom your hearts were consecrate,--
1648	Did they not all the Russian tongue
1649	With little knowledge and that wrong
1650	In charming fashion mutilate?
1651	Did not their lips with foreign speech
1652	The native Russian tongue impeach?
1653	God grant I meet not at a ball
1654	Or at a promenade mayhap,
1655	A schoolmaster in yellow shawl
1656	Or a professor in tulle cap.
1657	As rosy lips without a smile,
1658	The Russian language I deem vile
1659	Without grammatical mistakes.
1660	May be, and this my terror wakes,
1661	The fair of the next generation,
1662	As every journal now entreats,
1663	Will teach grammatical conceits,
1664	Introduce verse in conversation.
1665	But I--what is all this to me?
1666	Will to the old times faithful be.Speech careless, incorrect, but soft,
1667	With inexact pronunciation
1668	Raises within my breast as oft
1669	As formerly much agitation.
1670	Repentance wields not now her spell
1671	And gallicisms I love as well
1672	As the sins of my youthful days
1673	Or Bogdanovitch's sweet lays.
1674	But I must now employ my Muse
1675	With the epistle of my fair;
1676	I promised!--Did I so?--Well, there!
1677	Now I am ready to refuse.
1678	I know that Parny's tender pen
1679	Is no more cherished amongst men.
1680	Bard of the "Feasts," and mournful breast,
1681	If thou wert sitting by my side,
1682	With this immoderate request
1683	I should alarm our friendship tried:
1684	In one of thine enchanting lays
1685	To russify the foreign phrase
1686	Of my impassioned heroine.
1687	Where art thou? Come! pretensions mine
1688	I yield with a low reverence;
1689	But lonely beneath Finnish skies
1690	Where melancholy rocks arise
1691	He wanders in his indolence;
1692	Careless of fame his spirit high
1693	Hears not my importunity!
1694	Tattiana's letter I possess,
1695	I guard it as a holy thing,
1696	And though I read it with distress,
1697	I'm o'er it ever pondering.
1698	Inspired by whom this tenderness,
1699	This gentle daring who could guess?
1700	Who this soft nonsense could impart,
1701	Imprudent prattle of the heart,
1702	Attractive in its banefulness?
1703	I cannot understand. But lo!
1704	A feeble version read below,
1705	A print without the picture's grace,
1706	Or, as it were, the Freischutz' score
1707	Strummed by a timid schoolgirl o'er.I write to you! Is more required?
1708	Can lower depths beyond remain?
1709	'Tis in your power now, if desired,
1710	To crush me with a just disdain.
1711	But if my lot unfortunate
1712	You in the least commiserate
1713	You will not all abandon me.
1714	At first, I clung to secrecy:
1715	Believe me, of my present shame
1716	You never would have heard the name,
1717	If the fond hope I could have fanned
1718	At times, if only once a week,
1719	To see you by our fireside stand,
1720	To listen to the words you speak,
1721	Address to you one single phrase
1722	And then to meditate for days
1723	Of one thing till again we met.
1724	'Tis said you are a misanthrope,
1725	In country solitude you mope,
1726	And we--an unattractive set--
1727	Can hearty welcome give alone.
1728	Why did you visit our poor place?
1729	Forgotten in the village lone,
1730	I never should have seen your face
1731	And bitter torment never known.
1732	The untutored spirit's pangs calmed down
1733	By time
1734	I had found my predestinate,
1735	Become a faithful wife and e'en
1736	A fond and careful mother been.
1737	Another! to none other I
1738	My heart's allegiance can resign,
1739	My doom has been pronounced on high,
1740	'Tis Heaven's will and I am thine.
1741	The sum of my existence gone
1742	But promise of our meeting gave,
1743	I feel thou wast by God sent down
1744	My guardian angel to the grave.
1745	Thou didst to me in dreams appear,
1746	Unseen thou wast already dear.
1747	Thine eye subdued me with strange glance,
1748	I heard thy voice's resonance
1749	Long ago. Dream it cannot be!
1750	Scarce hadst thou entered thee I knew,
1751	I flushed up, stupefied I grew,
1752	And cried within myself: 'tis he!
1753	Is it not truth? in tones suppressed
1754	With thee I conversed when I bore
1755	Comfort and succour to the poor,
1756	And when I prayer to Heaven addressed
1757	To ease the anguish of my breast.
1758	Nay! even as this instant fled,
1759	Was it not thou, O vision bright,
1760	That glimmered through the radiant night
1761	And gently hovered o'er my head?
1762	Was it not thou who thus didst stoop
1763	To whisper comfort, love and hope?
1764	Who art thou? Guardian angel sent
1765	Or torturer malevolent?
1766	Doubt and uncertainty decide:
1767	All this may be an empty dream,
1768	Delusions of a mind untried,
1769	Providence otherwise may deem--
1770	Then be it so! My destiny
1771	From henceforth I confide to thee!
1772	Lo! at thy feet my tears I pour
1773	And thy protection I implore.
1774	Imagine! Here alone am I!
1775	No one my anguish comprehends,
1776	At times my reason almost bends,
1777	And silently I here must die--
1778	But I await thee: scarce alive
1779	My heart with but one look revive;
1780	Or to disturb my dreams approach
1781	Alas! with merited reproach.
1782	'Tis finished. Horrible to read!
1783	With shame I shudder and with dread--
1784	But boldly I myself resign:
1785	Thine honour is my countersign!Tattiana moans and now she sighs
1786	And in her grasp the letter shakes,
1787	Even the rosy wafer dries
1788	Upon her tongue which fever bakes.
1789	Her head upon her breast declines
1790	And an enchanting shoulder shines
1791	From her half-open vest of night.
1792	But lo! already the moon's light
1793	Is waning. Yonder valley deep
1794	Looms gray behind the mist and morn
1795	Silvers the brook; the shepherd's horn
1796	Arouses rustics from their sleep.
1797	'Tis day, the family downstairs,
1798	But nought for this Tattiana cares.The break of day she doth not see,
1799	But sits in bed with air depressed,
1800	Nor on the letter yet hath she
1801	The image of her seal impressed.
1802	But gray Phillippevna the door
1803	Opened with care, and entering bore
1804	A cup of tea upon a tray.
1805	"'Tis time, my child, arise, I pray!
1806	My beauty, thou art ready too.
1807	My morning birdie, yesternight
1808	I was half silly with affright.
1809	But praised be God! in health art thou!
1810	The pains of night have wholly fled,
1811	Thy cheek is as a poppy red!""Ah! nurse, a favour do for me!"--
1812	"Command me, darling, what you choose"--
1813	"Do not--you might--suspicious be;
1814	But look you--ah! do not refuse."
1815	"I call to witness God on high--"
1816	"Then send your grandson quietly
1817	To take this letter to O-- Well!
1818	Unto our neighbour. Mind you tell--
1819	Command him not to say a word--
1820	I mean my name not to repeat."
1821	"To whom is it to go, my sweet?
1822	Of late I have been quite absurd,--
1823	So many neighbours here exist--
1824	Am I to go through the whole list?""How dull you are this morning, nurse!"
1825	"My darling, growing old am I!
1826	In age the memory gets worse,
1827	But I was sharp in times gone by.
1828	In times gone by thy bare command--"
1829	"Oh! nurse, nurse, you don't understand!
1830	What is thy cleverness to me?
1831	The letter is the thing, you see,--
1832	Oneguine's letter!"--"Ah! the thing!
1833	Now don't be cross with me, my soul,
1834	You know that I am now a fool--
1835	But why are your cheeks whitening?"
1836	"Nothing, good nurse, there's nothing wrong,
1837	But send your grandson before long."No answer all that day was borne.
1838	Another passed; 'twas just the same.
1839	Pale as a ghost and dressed since morn
1840	Tattiana waits. No answer came!
1841	Olga's admirer came that day:
1842	"Tell me, why doth your comrade stay?"
1843	The hostess doth interrogate:
1844	"He hath neglected us of late."--
1845	Tattiana blushed, her heart beat quick--
1846	"He promised here this day to ride,"
1847	Lenski unto the dame replied,
1848	"The post hath kept him, it is like."
1849	Shamefaced, Tattiana downward looked
1850	As if he cruelly had joked!'Twas dusk! Upon the table bright
1851	Shrill sang the _samovar_ at eve,
1852	The china teapot too ye might
1853	In clouds of steam above perceive.
1854	Into the cups already sped
1855	By Olga's hand distributed
1856	The fragrant tea in darkling stream,
1857	And a boy handed round the cream.
1858	Tania doth by the casement linger
1859	And breathes upon the chilly glass,
1860	Dreaming of what not, pretty lass,
1861	And traces with a slender finger
1862	Upon its damp opacity,
1863	The mystic monogram, O. E.
1864	In the meantime her spirit sinks,
1865	Her weary eyes are filled with tears--
1866	A horse's hoofs she hears--She shrinks!
1867	Nearer they come--Eugene appears!
1868	Ah! than a spectre from the dead
1869	More swift the room Tattiana fled,
1870	From hall to yard and garden flies,
1871	Not daring to cast back her eyes.
1872	She fears and like an arrow rushes
1873	Through park and meadow, wood and brake,
1874	The bridge and alley to the lake,
1875	Brambles she snaps and lilacs crushes,
1876	The flowerbeds skirts, the brook doth meet,
1877	Till out of breath upon a seatShe sank.--
1878	"He's here! Eugene is here!
1879	Merciful God, what will he deem?"
1880	Yet still her heart, which torments tear,
1881	Guards fondly hope's uncertain dream.
1882	She waits, on fire her trembling frame--
1883	Will he pursue?--But no one came.
1884	She heard of servant-maids the note,
1885	Who in the orchards gathered fruit,
1886	Singing in chorus all the while.
1887	(This by command; for it was found,
1888	However cherries might abound,
1889	They disappeared by stealth and guile,
1890	So mouths they stopt with song, not fruit--
1891	Device of rural minds acute!)Young maidens, fair maidens,
1892	Friends and companions,
1893	Disport yourselves, maidens,
1894	Arouse yourselves, fair ones.
1895	Come sing we in chorus
1896	The secrets of maidens.
1897	Allure the young gallant
1898	With dance and with song.
1899	As we lure the young gallant,
1900	Espy him approaching,
1901	Disperse yourselves, darlings,
1902	And pelt him with cherries,
1903	With cherries, red currants,
1904	With raspberries, cherries.
1905	Approach not to hearken
1906	To secrets of virgins,
1907	Approach not to gaze at
1908	The frolics of maidens.They sang, whilst negligently seated,
1909	Attentive to the echoing sound,
1910	Tattiana with impatience waited
1911	Until her heart less high should bound--
1912	Till the fire in her cheek decreased;
1913	But tremor still her frame possessed,
1914	Nor did her blushes fade away,
1915	More crimson every moment they.
1916	Thus shines the wretched butterfly,
1917	With iridescent wing doth flap
1918	When captured in a schoolboy's cap;
1919	Thus shakes the hare when suddenly
1920	She from the winter corn espies
1921	A sportsman who in covert lies.But finally she heaves a sigh,
1922	And rising from her bench proceeds;
1923	But scarce had turned the corner nigh,
1924	Which to the neighbouring alley leads,
1925	When Eugene like a ghost did rise
1926	Before her straight with roguish eyes.
1927	Tattiana faltered, and became
1928	Scarlet as burnt by inward flame.
1929	But this adventure's consequence
1930	To-day, my friends, at any rate,
1931	I am not strong enough to state;
1932	I, after so much eloquence,
1933	Must take a walk and rest a bit--
1934	Some day I'll somehow finish it.
1935	Rural LifeCanto The FourthThe less we love a lady fair
1936	The easier 'tis to gain her grace,
1937	And the more surely we ensnare
1938	Her in the pitfalls which we place.
1939	Time was when cold seduction strove
1940	To swagger as the art of love,
1941	Everywhere trumpeting its feats,
1942	Not seeking love but sensual sweets.
1943	But this amusement delicate
1944	Was worthy of that old baboon,
1945	Our fathers used to dote upon;
1946	The Lovelaces are out of date,
1947	Their glory with their heels of red
1948	And long perukes hath vanished.
1949	For who imposture can endure,
1950	A constant harping on one tune,
1951	Serious endeavours to assure
1952	What everybody long has known;
1953	Ever to hear the same replies
1954	And overcome antipathies
1955	Which never have existed, e'en
1956	In little maidens of thirteen?
1957	And what like menaces fatigues,
1958	Entreaties, oaths, fictitious fear,
1959	Epistles of six sheets or near,
1960	Rings, tears, deceptions and intrigues,
1961	Aunts, mothers and their scrutiny,
1962	And husbands' tedious amity?
1963	Such were the musings of Eugene.
1964	He in the early years of life
1965	Had a deluded victim been
1966	Of error and the passions' strife.
1967	By daily life deteriorated,
1968	Awhile this beauty captivated,
1969	And that no longer could inspire.
1970	Slowly exhausted by desire,
1971	Yet satiated with success,
1972	In solitude or worldly din,
1973	He heard his soul's complaint within,
1974	With laughter smothered weariness:
1975	And thus he spent eight years of time,
1976	Destroyed the blossom of his prime.
1977	Though beauty he no more adored,
1978	He still made love in a queer way;
1979	Rebuffed--as quickly reassured,
1980	Jilted--glad of a holiday.
1981	Without enthusiasm he met
1982	The fair, nor parted with regret,
1983	Scarce mindful of their love and guile.
1984	Thus a guest with composure will
1985	To take a hand at whist oft come:
1986	He takes his seat, concludes his game,
1987	And straight returning whence he came,
1988	Tranquilly goes to sleep at home,
1989	And in the morning doth not know
1990	Whither that evening he will go.
1991	However, Tania's letter reading,
1992	Eugene was touched with sympathy;
1993	The language of her girlish pleading
1994	Aroused in him sweet reverie.
1995	He called to mind Tattiana's grace,
1996	Pallid and melancholy face,
1997	And in a vision, sinless, bright,
1998	His spirit sank with strange delight.
1999	May be the empire of the sense,
2000	Regained authority awhile,
2001	But he desired not to beguile
2002	Such open-hearted innocence.
2003	But to the garden once again
2004	Wherein we lately left the twain.
2005	Two minutes they in silence spent,
2006	Oneguine then approached and said:
2007	"You have a letter to me sent.
2008	Do not excuse yourself. I read
2009	Confessions which a trusting heart
2010	May well in innocence impart.
2011	Charming is your sincerity,
2012	Feelings which long had ceased to be
2013	It wakens in my breast again.
2014	But I came not to adulate:
2015	Your frankness I shall compensate
2016	By an avowal just as plain.
2017	An ear to my confession lend;
2018	To thy decree my will I bend.
2019	"If the domestic hearth could bless--
2020	My sum of happiness contained;
2021	If wife and children to possess
2022	A happy destiny ordained:
2023	If in the scenes of home I might
2024	E'en for an instant find delight,
2025	Then, I say truly, none but thee
2026	I would desire my bride to be--
2027	I say without poetic phrase,
2028	Found the ideal of my youth,
2029	Thee only would I choose, in truth,
2030	As partner of my mournful days,
2031	Thee only, pledge of all things bright,
2032	And be as happy--as I might.
2033	"But strange am I to happiness;
2034	'Tis foreign to my cast of thought;
2035	Me your perfections would not bless;
2036	I am not worthy them in aught;
2037	And honestly 'tis my belief
2038	Our union would produce but grief.
2039	Though now my love might be intense,
2040	Habit would bring indifference.
2041	I see you weep. Those tears of yours
2042	Tend not my heart to mitigate,
2043	But merely to exasperate;
2044	Judge then what roses would be ours,
2045	What pleasures Hymen would prepare
2046	For us, may be for many a year.
2047	"What can be drearier than the house,
2048	Wherein the miserable wife
2049	Deplores a most unworthy spouse
2050	And leads a solitary life?
2051	The tiresome man, her value knowing,
2052	Yet curses on his fate bestowing,
2053	Is full of frigid jealousy,
2054	Mute, solemn, frowning gloomily.
2055	Such am I. This did ye expect,
2056	When in simplicity ye wrote
2057	Your innocent and charming note
2058	With so much warmth and intellect?
2059	Hath fate apportioned unto thee
2060	This lot in life with stern decree?"Ideas and time ne'er backward move;
2061	My soul I cannot renovate--
2062	I love you with a brother's love,
2063	Perchance one more affectionate.
2064	Listen to me without disdain.
2065	A maid hath oft, may yet again
2066	Replace the visions fancy drew;
2067	Thus trees in spring their leaves renew
2068	As in their turn the seasons roll.
2069	'Tis evidently Heaven's will
2070	You fall in love again. But still--
2071	Learn to possess more self-control.
2072	Not all will like myself proceed--
2073	And thoughtlessness to woe might lead."Thus did our friend Oneguine preach:
2074	Tattiana, dim with tears her eyes,
2075	Attentive listened to his speech,
2076	All breathless and without replies.
2077	His arm he offers. Mute and sad,
2078	Tattiana doth accept his aid;
2079	And, hanging down her head, the maid
2080	Around the garden homeward hies.
2081	Together they returned, nor word
2082	Of censure for the same incurred;
2083	The country hath its liberties
2084	And privileges nice allowed,
2085	Even as Moscow, city proud.Confess, O ye who this peruse,
2086	Oneguine acted very well
2087	By poor Tattiana in the blues;
2088	'Twas not the first time, I can tell
2089	You, he a noble mind disclosed,
2090	Though some men, evilly disposed,
2091	Spared him not their asperities.
2092	His friends and also enemies
2093	Esteemed him much as the world goes.
2094	Yes! every one must have his foes,
2095	But Lord! from friends deliver me!
2096	The deuce take friends, my friends, amends
2097	I've had to make for having friends!But how? Quite so. Though I dismiss
2098	Dark, unavailing reverie,
2099	I just hint, in parenthesis,
2100	There is no stupid calumny
2101	Born of a babbler in a loft
2102	And by the world repeated oft,
2103	There is no fishmarket retort
2104	And no ridiculous report,
2105	Which your true friend with a sweet smile
2106	Where fashionable circles meet
2107	A hundred times will not repeat,
2108	Quite inadvertently meanwhile;
2109	And yet he in your cause would strive
2110	And loves you as--a relative!Ahem! Ahem! My reader noble,
2111	Are all your relatives quite well?
2112	Permit me; is it worth the trouble
2113	For your instruction here to tell
2114	What I by relatives conceive?
2115	These are your relatives, believe:
2116	Those whom we ought to love, caress,
2117	With spiritual tenderness;
2118	Whom, as the custom is of men,
2119	We visit about Christmas Day,
2120	Or by a card our homage pay,
2121	That until Christmas comes again
2122	They may forget that we exist.
2123	And so--God bless them, if He list.In this the love of the fair sex
2124	Beats that of friends and relatives:
2125	In love, although its tempests vex,
2126	Our liberty at least survives:
2127	Agreed! but then the whirl of fashion,
2128	The natural fickleness of passion,
2129	The torrent of opinion,
2130	And the fair sex as light as down!
2131	Besides the hobbies of a spouse
2132	Should be respected throughout life
2133	By every proper-minded wife,
2134	And this the faithful one allows,
2135	When in as instant she is lost,--
2136	Satan will jest, and at love's cost.Oh! where bestow our love? Whom trust?
2137	Where is he who doth not deceive?
2138	Who words and actions will adjust
2139	To standards in which we believe?
2140	Oh! who is not calumnious?
2141	Who labours hard to humour us?
2142	To whom are our misfortunes grief
2143	And who is not a tiresome thief?
2144	My venerated reader, oh!
2145	Cease the pursuit of shadows vain,
2146	Spare yourself unavailing pain
2147	And all your love on self bestow;
2148	A worthy object 'tis, and well
2149	I know there's none more amiable.But from the interview what flowed?
2150	Alas! It is not hard to guess.
2151	The insensate fire of love still glowed
2152	Nor discontinued to distress
2153	A spirit which for sorrow yearned.
2154	Tattiana more than ever burned
2155	With hopeless passion: from her bed
2156	Sweet slumber winged its way and fled.
2157	Her health, life's sweetness and its bloom,
2158	Her smile and maidenly repose,
2159	All vanished as an echo goes.
2160	Across her youth a shade had come,
2161	As when the tempest's veil is drawn
2162	Across the smiling face of dawn.Alas! Tattiana fades away,
2163	Grows pale and sinks, but nothing says;
2164	Listless is she the livelong day
2165	Nor interest in aught betrays.
2166	Shaking with serious air the head,
2167	In whispers low the neighbours said:
2168	'Tis time she to the altar went!
2169	But enough! Now, 'tis my intent
2170	The imagination to enliven
2171	With love which happiness extends;
2172	Against my inclination, friends,
2173	By sympathy I have been driven.
2174	Forgive me! Such the love I bear
2175	My heroine, Tattiana dear.Vladimir, hourly more a slave
2176	To youthful Olga's beauty bright,
2177	Into delicious bondage gave
2178	His ardent soul with full delight.
2179	Always together, eventide
2180	Found them in darkness side by side,
2181	At morn, hand clasped in hand, they rove
2182	Around the meadow and the grove.
2183	And what resulted? Drunk with love,
2184	But with confused and bashful air,
2185	Lenski at intervals would dare,
2186	If Olga smilingly approve,
2187	Dally with a dishevelled tress
2188	Or kiss the border of her dress.To Olga frequently he would
2189	Some nice instructive novel read,
2190	Whose author nature understood
2191	Better than Chateaubriand did
2192	Yet sometimes pages two or three
2193	(Nonsense and pure absurdity,
2194	For maiden's hearing deemed unfit),
2195	He somewhat blushing would omit:
2196	Far from the rest the pair would creep
2197	And  they
2198	A game of chess would often play,
2199	Buried in meditation deep,
2200	Till absently Vladimir took
2201	With his own pawn alas! his rook!Homeward returning, he at home
2202	Is occupied with Olga fair,
2203	An album, fly-leaf of the tome,
2204	He leisurely adorns for her.
2205	Landscapes thereon he would design,
2206	A tombstone, Aphrodite's shrine,
2207	Or, with a pen and colours fit,
2208	A dove which on a lyre doth sit;
2209	The "in memoriam" pages sought,
2210	Where many another hand had signed
2211	A tender couplet he combined,
2212	A register of fleeting thought,
2213	A flimsy trace of musings past
2214	Which might for many ages last.Surely ye all have overhauled
2215	A country damsel's album trim,
2216	Which all her darling friends have scrawled
2217	From first to last page to the rim.
2218	Behold! orthography despising,
2219	Metreless verses recognizing
2220	By friendship how they were abused,
2221	Hewn, hacked, and otherwise ill-used.
2222	Upon the opening page ye find:
2223	_Qu'ecrirer-vouz sur ces tablettes?_
2224	Subscribed, _toujours a vous, Annette;_
2225	And on the last one, underlined:
2226	_Who in thy love finds more delight
2227	Beyond this may attempt to write_.Infallibly you there will find
2228	Two hearts, a torch, of flowers a wreath,
2229	And vows will probably be signed:
2230	_Affectionately yours till death_.
2231	Some army poet therein may
2232	Have smuggled his flagitious lay.
2233	In such an album with delight
2234	I would, my friends, inscriptions write,
2235	Because I should be sure, meanwhile,
2236	My verses, kindly meant, would earn
2237	Delighted glances in return;
2238	That afterwards with evil smile
2239	They would not solemnly debate
2240	If cleverly or not I prate.But, O ye tomes without compare,
2241	Which from the devil's bookcase start,
2242	Albums magnificent which scare
2243	The fashionable rhymester's heart!
2244	Yea! although rendered beauteous
2245	By Tolstoy's pencil marvellous,
2246	Though Baratynski verses penned,
2247	The thunderbolt on you descend!
2248	Whene'er a brilliant courtly dame
2249	Presents her quarto amiably,
2250	Despair and anger seize on me,
2251	And a malicious epigram
2252	Trembles upon my lips from spite,--
2253	And madrigals I'm asked to write!
2254	But Lenski madrigals ne'er wrote
2255	In Olga's album, youthful maid,
2256	To purest love he tuned his note
2257	Nor frigid adulation paid.
2258	What never was remarked or heard
2259	Of Olga he in song averred;
2260	His elegies, which plenteous streamed,
2261	Both natural and truthful seemed.
2262	Thus thou, Yazykoff, dost arise
2263	In amorous flights when so inspired,
2264	Singing God knows what maid admired,
2265	And all thy precious elegies,
2266	Sometime collected, shall relate
2267	The story of thy life and fate.
2268	Since Fame and Freedom he adored,
2269	Incited by his stormy Muse
2270	Odes Lenski also had outpoured,
2271	But Olga would not such peruse.
2272	When poets lachrymose recite
2273	Beneath the eyes of ladies bright
2274	Their own productions, some insist
2275	No greater pleasure can exist
2276	Just so! that modest swain is blest
2277	Who reads his visionary theme
2278	To the fair object of his dream,
2279	A beauty languidly at rest,
2280	Yes, happy--though she at his side
2281	By other thoughts be occupied.But I the products of my Muse,
2282	Consisting of harmonious lays,
2283	To my old nurse alone peruse,
2284	Companion of my childhood's days.
2285	Or, after dinner's dull repast,
2286	I by the button-hole seize fast
2287	My neighbour, who by chance drew near,
2288	And breathe a drama in his ear.
2289	Or else ,
2290	Exhausted by my woes and rhymes,
2291	I sail upon my lake at times
2292	And terrify a swarm of ducks,
2293	Who, heard the music of my lay,
2294	Take to their wings and fly away.But to Oneguine! _A propos!_
2295	Friends, I must your indulgence pray.
2296	His daily occupations, lo!
2297	Minutely I will now portray.
2298	A hermit's life Oneguine led,
2299	At seven in summer rose from bed,
2300	And clad in airy costume took
2301	His course unto the running brook.
2302	There, aping Gulnare's bard, he spanned
2303	His Hellespont from bank to bank,
2304	And then a cup of coffee drank,
2305	Some wretched journal in his hand;
2306	Then dressed himself...
2307	Sound sleep, books, walking, were his bliss,
2308	The murmuring brook, the woodland shade,
2309	The uncontaminated kiss
2310	Of a young dark-eyed country maid,
2311	A fiery, yet well-broken horse,
2312	A dinner, whimsical each course,
2313	A bottle of a vintage white
2314	And solitude and calm delight.
2315	Such was Oneguine's sainted life,
2316	And such unconsciously he led,
2317	Nor marked how summer's prime had fled
2318	In aimless ease and far from strife,
2319	The curse of commonplace delight.
2320	And town and friends forgotten quite.This northern summer of our own,
2321	On winters of the south a skit,
2322	Glimmers and dies. This is well known,
2323	Though we will not acknowledge it.
2324	Already Autumn chilled the sky,
2325	The tiny sun shone less on high
2326	And shorter had the days become.
2327	The forests in mysterious gloom
2328	Were stripped with melancholy sound,
2329	Upon the earth a mist did lie
2330	And many a caravan on high
2331	Of clamorous geese flew southward bound.
2332	A weary season was at hand--
2333	November at the gate did stand.The morn arises foggy, cold,
2334	The silent fields no peasant nears,
2335	The wolf upon the highways bold
2336	With his ferocious mate appears.
2337	Detecting him the passing horse
2338	Snorts, and his rider bends his course
2339	And wisely gallops to the hill.
2340	No more at dawn the shepherd will
2341	Drive out the cattle from their shed,
2342	Nor at the hour of noon with sound
2343	Of horn in circle call them round.
2344	Singing inside her hut the maid
2345	Spins, whilst the friend of wintry night,
2346	The pine-torch, by her crackles bright.Already crisp hoar frosts impose
2347	O'er all a sheet of silvery dust
2348	(Readers expect the rhyme of _rose_,
2349	There! take it quickly, if ye must).
2350	Behold! than polished floor more nice
2351	The shining river clothed in ice;
2352	A joyous troop of little boys
2353	Engrave the ice with strident noise.
2354	A heavy goose on scarlet feet,
2355	Thinking to float upon the stream,
2356	Descends the bank with care extreme,
2357	But staggers, slips, and falls. We greet
2358	The first bright wreathing storm of snow
2359	Which falls in starry flakes below.How in the country pass this time?
2360	Walking? The landscape tires the eye
2361	In winter by its blank and dim
2362	And naked uniformity.
2363	On horseback gallop o'er the steppe!
2364	Your steed, though rough-shod, cannot keep
2365	His footing on the treacherous rime
2366	And may fall headlong any time.
2367	Alone beneath your rooftree stay
2368	And read De Pradt or Walter Scott!
2369	Keep your accounts! You'd rather not?
2370	Then get mad drunk or wroth; the day
2371	Will pass; the same to-morrow try--
2372	You'll spend your winter famously!
2373	A true Childe Harold my Eugene
2374	To idle musing was a prey;
2375	At morn an icy bath within
2376	He sat, and then the livelong day,
2377	Alone within his habitation
2378	And buried deep in meditation,
2379	He round the billiard-table stalked,
2380	The balls impelled, the blunt cue chalked;
2381	When evening o'er the landscape looms,
2382	Billiards abandoned, cue forgot,
2383	A table to the fire is brought,
2384	And he waits dinner. Lenski comes,
2385	Driving abreast three horses gray.
2386	"Bring dinner now without delay!"Upon the table in a trice
2387	Of widow Clicquot or Moet
2388	A blessed bottle, placed in ice,
2389	For the young poet they display.
2390	Like Hippocrene it scatters light,
2391	Its ebullition foaming white
2392	My heart of old would captivate.
2393	The last poor obol I was worth--
2394	Was it not so?--for thee I gave,
2395	And thy inebriating wave
2396	Full many a foolish prank brought forth;
2397	And oh! what verses, what delights,
2398	Delicious visions, jests and fights!Alas! my stomach it betrays
2399	With its exhilarating flow,
2400	And I confess that now-a-days
2401	I prefer sensible Bordeaux.
2402	To cope with Ay no more I dare,
2403	For Ay is like a mistress fair,
2404	Seductive, animated, bright,
2405	But wilful, frivolous, and light.
2406	But thou, Bordeaux, art like the friend
2407	Who in the agony of grief
2408	Is ever ready with relief,
2409	Assistance ever will extend,
2410	Or quietly partake our woe.
2411	All hail! my good old friend Bordeaux!The fire sinks low. An ashy cloak
2412	The golden ember now enshrines,
2413	And barely visible the smoke
2414	Upward in a thin stream inclines.
2415	But little warmth the fireplace lends,
2416	Tobacco smoke the flue ascends,
2417	The goblet still is bubbling bright--
2418	Outside descend the mists of night.
2419	How pleasantly the evening jogs
2420	When o'er a glass with friends we prate
2421	Just at the hour we designate
2422	The time between the wolf and dogs--
2423	I cannot tell on what pretence--
2424	But lo! the friends to chat commence."How are our neighbours fair, pray tell,
2425	Tattiana, saucy Olga thine?"--
2426	"The family are all quite well--
2427	Give me just half a glass of wine--
2428	They sent their compliments--but oh!
2429	How charming Olga's shoulders grow!
2430	Her figure perfect grows with time!
2431	She is an angel! We sometime
2432	Must visit them. Come! you must own,
2433	My friend, 'tis but to pay a debt,
2434	For twice you came to them and yet
2435	You never since your nose have shown.
2436	But stay! A dolt am I who speak!
2437	They have invited you this week.""Me?"--"Yes! It is Tattiana's fete
2438	Next Saturday. The Larina
2439	Told me to ask you. Ere that date
2440	Make up your mind to go there."--"Ah!
2441	It will be by a mob beset
2442	Of every sort and every set!"--
2443	"Not in the least, assured am I!"--
2444	"Who will be there?"--"The family.
2445	Do me a favour and appear.
2446	Will you?"--"Agreed."--"I thank you, friend,"
2447	And saying this Vladimir drained
2448	His cup unto his maiden dear.
2449	Then touching Olga they depart
2450	In fresh discourse. Such, love, thou art!He was most gay. The happy date
2451	In three weeks would arrive for them;
2452	The secrets of the marriage state
2453	And love's delicious diadem
2454	With rapturous longing he awaits,
2455	Nor in his dreams anticipates
2456	Hymen's embarrassments, distress,
2457	And freezing fits of weariness.
2458	Though we, of Hymen foes, meanwhile,
2459	In life domestic see a string
2460	Of pictures painful harrowing,
2461	A novel in Lafontaine's style,
2462	My wretched Lenski's fate I mourn,
2463	He seemed for matrimony born.He was beloved: or say at least,
2464	He thought so, and existence charmed.
2465	The credulous indeed are blest,
2466	And he who, jealousy disarmed,
2467	In sensual sweets his soul doth steep
2468	As drunken tramps at nightfall sleep,
2469	Or, parable more flattering,
2470	As butterflies to blossoms cling.
2471	But wretched who anticipates,
2472	Whose brain no fond illusions daze,
2473	Who every gesture, every phrase
2474	In true interpretation hates:
2475	Whose heart experience icy made
2476	And yet oblivion forbade.
2477	The Fete
2478	'Oh, do not dream these fearful dreams,
2479	O my Svetlana.'--Joukovski
2480	That year the autumn season late
2481	Kept lingering on as loath to go,
2482	All Nature winter seemed to await,
2483	Till January fell no snow--
2484	The third at night. Tattiana wakes
2485	Betimes, and sees, when morning breaks,
2486	Park, garden, palings, yard below
2487	And roofs near morn blanched o'er with snow;
2488	Upon the windows tracery,
2489	The trees in silvery array,
2490	Down in the courtyard magpies gay,
2491	And the far mountains daintily
2492	O'erspread with Winter's carpet bright,
2493	All so distinct, and all so white!
2494	Winter! The peasant blithely goes
2495	To labour in his sledge forgot,
2496	His pony sniffing the fresh snows
2497	Just manages a feeble trot
2498	Though deep he sinks into the drift;
2499	Forth the _kibitka_ gallops swift,
2500	Its driver seated on the rim
2501	In scarlet sash and sheepskin trim;
2502	Yonder the household lad doth run,
2503	Placed in a sledge his terrier black,
2504	Himself transformed into a hack;
2505	To freeze his finger hath begun,
2506	He laughs, although it aches from cold,
2507	His mother from the door doth scold.
2508	In scenes like these it may be though,
2509	Ye feel but little interest,
2510	They are all natural and low,
2511	Are not with elegance impressed.
2512	Another bard with art divine
2513	Hath pictured in his gorgeous line
2514	The first appearance of the snows
2515	And all the joys which Winter knows.
2516	He will delight you, I am sure,
2517	When he in ardent verse portrays
2518	Secret excursions made in sleighs;
2519	But competition I abjure
2520	Either with him or thee in song,
2521	Bard of the Finnish maiden young.
2522	Tattiana, Russian to the core,
2523	Herself not knowing well the reason,
2524	The Russian winter did adore
2525	And the cold beauties of the season:
2526	On sunny days the glistening rime,
2527	Sledging, the snows, which at the time
2528	Of sunset glow with rosy light,
2529	The misty evenings ere Twelfth Night.
2530	These evenings as in days of old
2531	The Larinas would celebrate,
2532	The servants used to congregate
2533	And the young ladies fortunes told,
2534	And every year distributed
2535	Journeys and warriors to wed.
2536	Tattiana in traditions old
2537	Believed, the people's wisdom weird,
2538	In dreams and what the moon foretold
2539	And what she from the cards inferred.
2540	Omens inspired her soul with fear,
2541	Mysteriously all objects near
2542	A hidden meaning could impart,
2543	Presentiments oppressed her heart.
2544	Lo! the prim cat upon the stove
2545	With one paw strokes her face and purrs,
2546	Tattiana certainly infers
2547	That guests approach: and when above
2548	The new moon's crescent slim she spied,
2549	Suddenly to the left hand side,
2550	She trembled and grew deadly pale.
2551	Or a swift meteor, may be,
2552	Across the gloom of heaven would sail
2553	And disappear in space; then she
2554	Would haste in agitation dire
2555	To mutter her concealed desire
2556	Ere the bright messenger had set.
2557	When in her walks abroad she met
2558	A friar black approaching near,
2559	Or a swift hare from mead to mead
2560	Had run across her path at speed,
2561	Wholly beside herself with fear,
2562	Anticipating woe she pined,
2563	Certain misfortune near opined.
2564	Wherefore? She found a secret joy
2565	In horror for itself alone,
2566	Thus Nature doth our souls alloy,
2567	Thus her perversity hath shown.
2568	Twelfth Night approaches. Merry eves!
2569	When thoughtless youth whom nothing grieves,
2570	Before whose inexperienced sight
2571	Life lies extended, vast and bright,
2572	To peer into the future tries.
2573	Old age through spectacles too peers,
2574	Although the destined coffin nears,
2575	Having lost all in life we prize.
2576	It matters not. Hope e'en to these
2577	With childlike lisp will lie to please.
2578	Tattiana gazed with curious eye
2579	On melted wax in water poured;
2580	The clue unto some mystery
2581	She deemed its outline might afford.
2582	Rings from a dish of water full
2583	In order due the maidens pull;
2584	But when Tattiana's hand had ta'en
2585	A ring she heard the ancient strain:
2586	_The peasants there are rich as kings,
2587	They shovel silver with a spade,
2588	He whom we sing to shall be made
2589	Happy and glorious_. But this brings
2590	With sad refrain misfortune near.
2591	Girls the _kashourka_ much prefer.
2592	Frosty the night; the heavens shone;
2593	The wondrous host of heavenly spheres
2594	Sailed silently in unison--
2595	Tattiana in the yard appears
2596	In a half-open dressing-gown
2597	And bends her mirror on the moon,
2598	But trembling on the mirror dark
2599	The sad moon only could remark.
2600	List! the snow crunches--he draws nigh!
2601	The girl on tiptoe forward bounds
2602	And her voice sweeter than the sounds
2603	Of clarinet or flute doth cry:
2604	"What is your name?" The boor looked dazed,
2605	And "Agathon" replied, amazed.
2606	Tattiana
2607	By night prepared for sorcery,
2608	And in the bathroom did command
2609	To lay two covers secretly.
2610	But sudden fear assailed Tattiana,
2611	And I, remembering Svetlana,
2612	Become alarmed. So never mind!
2613	I'm not for witchcraft now inclined.
2614	So she her silken sash unlaced,
2615	Undressed herself and went to bed
2616	And soon Lel hovered o'er her head.
2617	Beneath her downy pillow placed,
2618	A little virgin mirror peeps.
2619	'Tis silent all. Tattiana sleeps.
2620	A dreadful sleep Tattiana sleeps.
2621	She dreamt she journeyed o'er a field
2622	All covered up with snow in heaps,
2623	By melancholy fogs concealed.
2624	Amid the snowdrifts which surround
2625	A stream, by winter's ice unbound,
2626	Impetuously clove its way
2627	With boiling torrent dark and gray;
2628	Two poles together glued by ice,
2629	A fragile bridge and insecure,
2630	Spanned the unbridled torrent o'er;
2631	Beside the thundering abyss
2632	Tattiana in despair unfeigned
2633	Rooted unto the spot remained.As if against obstruction sore
2634	Tattiana o'er the stream complained;
2635	To help her to the other shore
2636	No one appeared to lend a hand.
2637	But suddenly a snowdrift stirs,
2638	And what from its recess appears?
2639	A bristly bear of monstrous size!
2640	He roars, and "Ah!" Tattiana cries.
2641	He offers her his murderous paw;
2642	She nerves herself from her alarm
2643	And leans upon the monster's arm,
2644	With footsteps tremulous with awe
2645	Passes the torrent But alack!
2646	Bruin is marching at her back!She, to turn back her eyes afraid,
2647	Accelerates her hasty pace,
2648	But cannot anyhow evade
2649	Her shaggy myrmidon in chase.
2650	The bear rolls on with many a grunt:
2651	A forest now she sees in front
2652	With fir-trees standing motionless
2653	In melancholy loveliness,
2654	Their branches by the snow bowed down.
2655	Through aspens, limes and birches bare,
2656	The shining orbs of night appear;
2657	There is no path; the storm hath strewn
2658	Both bush and brake, ravine and steep,
2659	And all in snow is buried deep.The wood she enters--bear behind,--
2660	In snow she sinks up to the knee;
2661	Now a long branch itself entwined
2662	Around her neck, now violently
2663	Away her golden earrings tore;
2664	Now the sweet little shoes she wore,
2665	Grown clammy, stick fast in the snow;
2666	Her handkerchief she loses now;
2667	No time to pick it up! afraid,
2668	She hears the bear behind her press,
2669	Nor dares the skirting of her dress
2670	For shame lift up the modest maid.
2671	She runs, the bear upon her trail,
2672	Until her powers of running fail.She sank upon the snow. But Bruin
2673	Adroitly seized and carried her;
2674	Submissive as if in a swoon,
2675	She cannot draw a breath or stir.
2676	He dragged her by a forest road
2677	Till amid trees a hovel showed,
2678	By barren snow heaped up and bound,
2679	A tangled wilderness around.
2680	Bright blazed the window of the place,
2681	Within resounded shriek and shout:
2682	"My chum lives here," Bruin grunts out.
2683	"Warm yourself here a little space!"
2684	Straight for the entrance then he made
2685	And her upon the threshold laid.Recovering, Tania gazes round;
2686	Bear gone--she at the threshold placed;
2687	Inside clink glasses, cries resound
2688	As if it were some funeral feast.
2689	But deeming all this nonsense pure,
2690	She peeped through a chink of the door.
2691	What doth she see? Around the board
2692	Sit many monstrous shapes abhorred.
2693	A canine face with horns thereon,
2694	Another with cock's head appeared,
2695	Here an old witch with hirsute beard,
2696	There an imperious skeleton;
2697	A dwarf adorned with tail, again
2698	A shape half cat and half a crane.Yet ghastlier, yet more wonderful,
2699	A crab upon a spider rides,
2700	Perched on a goose's neck a skull
2701	In scarlet cap revolving glides.
2702	A windmill too a jig performs
2703	And wildly waves its arms and storms;
2704	Barking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse,
2705	The speech of man and tramp of horse.
2706	But wide Tattiana oped her eyes
2707	When in that company she saw
2708	Him who inspired both love and awe,
2709	The hero we immortalize.
2710	Oneguine sat the table by
2711	And viewed the door with cunning eye.All bustle when he makes a sign:
2712	He drinks, all drink and loudly call;
2713	He smiles, in laughter all combine;
2714	He knits his brows--'tis silent all.
2715	He there is master--that is plain;
2716	Tattiana courage doth regain
2717	And grown more curious by far
2718	Just placed the entrance door ajar.
2719	The wind rose instantly, blew out
2720	The fire of the nocturnal lights;
2721	A trouble fell upon the sprites;
2722	Oneguine lightning glances shot;
2723	Furious he from the table rose;
2724	All arise. To the door he goes.Terror assails her. Hastily
2725	Tattiana would attempt to fly,
2726	She cannot--then impatiently
2727	She strains her throat to force a cry--
2728	She cannot--Eugene oped the door
2729	And the young girl appeared before
2730	Those hellish phantoms. Peals arise
2731	Of frantic laughter, and all eyes
2732	And hoofs and crooked snouts and paws,
2733	Tails which a bushy tuft adorns,
2734	Whiskers and bloody tongues and horns,
2735	Sharp rows of tushes, bony claws,
2736	Are turned upon her. All combine
2737	In one great shout: she's mine! she's mine!"Mine!" cried Eugene with savage tone.
2738	The troop of apparitions fled,
2739	And in the frosty night alone
2740	Remained with him the youthful maid.
2741	With tranquil air Oneguine leads
2742	Tattiana to a corner, bids
2743	Her on a shaky bench sit down;
2744	His head sinks slowly, rests upon
2745	Her shoulder--Olga swiftly came--
2746	And Lenski followed--a light broke--
2747	His fist Oneguine fiercely shook
2748	And gazed around with eyes of flame;
2749	The unbidden guests he roughly chides--
2750	Tattiana motionless abides.The strife grew furious and Eugene
2751	Grasped a long knife and instantly
2752	Struck Lenski dead--across the scene
2753	Dark shadows thicken--a dread cry
2754	Was uttered, and the cabin shook--
2755	Tattiana terrified awoke.
2756	She gazed around her--it was day.
2757	Lo! through the frozen windows play
2758	Aurora's ruddy rays of light--
2759	The door flew open--Olga came,
2760	More blooming than the Boreal flame
2761	And swifter than the swallow's flight.
2762	"Come," she cried, "sister, tell me e'en
2763	Whom you in slumber may have seen."But she, her sister never heeding,
2764	With book in hand reclined in bed,
2765	Page after page continued reading,
2766	But no reply unto her made.
2767	Although her book did not contain
2768	The bard's enthusiastic strain,
2769	Nor precepts sage nor pictures e'en,
2770	Yet neither Virgil nor Racine
2771	Nor Byron, Walter Scott, nor Seneca,
2772	Nor the _Journal des Modes_, I vouch,
2773	Ever absorbed a maid so much:
2774	Its name, my friends, was Martin Zadeka,
2775	The chief of the Chaldean wise,
2776	Who dreams expound and prophecies.Brought by a pedlar vagabond
2777	Unto their solitude one day,
2778	This monument of thought profound
2779	Tattiana purchased with a stray
2780	Tome of "Malvina," and but three
2781	And a half rubles down gave she;
2782	Also, to equalise the scales,
2783	She got a book of nursery tales,
2784	A grammar, likewise Petriads two,
2785	Marmontel also, tome the third;
2786	Tattiana every day conferred
2787	With Martin Zadeka. In woe
2788	She consolation thence obtained--
2789	Inseparable they remained.
2790	The dream left terror in its train.
2791	Not knowing its interpretation,
2792	Tania the meaning would obtain
2793	Of such a dread hallucination.
2794	Tattiana to the index flies
2795	And alphabetically tries
2796	The words _bear, bridge, fir, darkness, bog,
2797	Raven, snowstorm, tempest, fog,
2798	Et cetera_; but nothing showed
2799	Her Martin Zadeka in aid,
2800	Though the foul vision promise made
2801	Of a most mournful episode,
2802	And many a day thereafter laid
2803	A load of care upon the maid."But lo! forth from the valleys dun
2804	With purple hand Aurora leads,
2805	Swift following in her wake, the sun,"
2806	And a grand festival proceeds.
2807	The Larinas were since sunrise
2808	O'erwhelmed with guests; by families
2809	The neighbours come, in sledge approach,
2810	Britzka, kibitka, or in coach.
2811	Crush and confusion in the hall,
2812	Latest arrivals' salutations,
2813	Barking, young ladies' osculations,
2814	Shouts, laughter, jamming 'gainst the wall,
2815	Bows and the scrape of many feet,
2816	Nurses who scream and babes who bleat.
2817	Bringing his partner corpulent
2818	Fat Poustiakoff drove to the door;
2819	Gvozdine, a landlord excellent,
2820	Oppressor of the wretched poor;
2821	And the Skatenines, aged pair,
2822	With all their progeny were there,
2823	Who from two years to thirty tell;
2824	Petoushkoff, the provincial swell;
2825	Bouyanoff too, my cousin, wore
2826	His wadded coat and cap with peak;
2827	And Flianoff, pensioned councillor,
2828	Rogue and extortioner of yore,
2829	Now buffoon, glutton, and a bore.
2830	The family of Kharlikoff,
2831	Came with Monsieur Triquet, a prig,
2832	Who arrived lately from Tamboff,
2833	In spectacles and chestnut wig.
2834	Like a true Frenchman, couplets wrought
2835	In Tania's praise in pouch he brought,
2836	Known unto children perfectly:
2837	_Reveillez-vouz, belle endormie_.
2838	Among some ancient ballads thrust,
2839	He found them in an almanac,
2840	And the sagacious Triquet back
2841	To light had brought them from their dust,
2842	Whilst he "belle Nina" had the face
2843	By "belle Tattiana" to replace.Lo! from the nearest barrack came,
2844	Of old maids the divinity,
2845	And comfort of each country dame,
2846	The captain of a company.
2847	He enters. Ah! good news to-day!
2848	The military band will play.
2849	The colonel sent it. Oh! delight!
2850	So there will be a dance to-night.
2851	Girls in anticipation skip!
2852	But dinner-time comes. Two and two
2853	They hand in hand to table go.
2854	The maids beside Tattiana keep--
2855	Men opposite. The cross they sign
2856	And chattering loud sit down to dine.Ceased for a space all chattering.
2857	Jaws are at work. On every side
2858	Plates, knives and forks are clattering
2859	And ringing wine-glasses are plied.
2860	But by degrees the crowd begin
2861	To raise a clamour and a din:
2862	They laugh, they argue, and they bawl,
2863	They shout and no one lists at all.
2864	The doors swing open: Lenski makes
2865	His entrance with Oneguine. "Ah!
2866	At last the author!" cries Mamma.
2867	The guests make room; aside each takes
2868	His chair, plate, knife and fork in haste;
2869	The friends are called and quickly placed.Right opposite Tattiana placed,
2870	She, than the morning moon more pale,
2871	More timid than a doe long chased,
2872	Lifts not her eyes which swimming fail.
2873	Anew the flames of passion start
2874	Within her; she is sick at heart;
2875	The two friends' compliments she hears
2876	Not, and a flood of bitter tears
2877	With effort she restrains. Well nigh
2878	The poor girl fell into a faint,
2879	But strength of mind and self-restraint
2880	Prevailed at last. She in reply
2881	Said something in an undertone
2882	And at the table sat her down.To tragedy, the fainting fit,
2883	And female tears hysterical,
2884	Oneguine could not now submit,
2885	For long he had endured them all.
2886	Our misanthrope was full of ire,
2887	At a great feast against desire,
2888	And marking Tania's agitation,
2889	Cast down his eyes in trepidation
2890	And sulked in silent indignation;
2891	Swearing how Lenski he would rile,
2892	Avenge himself in proper style.
2893	Triumphant by anticipation,
2894	Caricatures he now designed
2895	Of all the guests within his mind.Certainly not Eugene alone
2896	Tattiana's trouble might have spied,
2897	But that the eyes of every one
2898	By a rich pie were occupied--
2899	Unhappily too salt by far;
2900	And that a bottle sealed with tar
2901	Appeared, Don's effervescing boast,
2902	Between the blanc-mange and the roast;
2903	Behind, of glasses an array,
2904	Tall, slender, like thy form designed,
2905	Zizi, thou mirror of my mind,
2906	Fair object of my guileless lay,
2907	Seductive cup of love, whose flow
2908	Made me so tipsy long ago!
2909	From the moist cork the bottle freed
2910	With loud explosion, the bright wine
2911	Hissed forth. With serious air indeed,
2912	Long tortured by his lay divine,
2913	Triquet arose, and for the bard
2914	The company deep silence guard.
2915	Tania well nigh expired when he
2916	Turned to her and discordantly
2917	Intoned it, manuscript in hand.
2918	Voices and hands applaud, and she
2919	Must bow in common courtesy;
2920	The poet, modest though so grand,
2921	Drank to her health in the first place,
2922	Then handed her the song with grace.Congratulations, toasts resound,
2923	Tattiana thanks to all returned,
2924	But, when Oneguine's turn came round,
2925	The maiden's weary eye which yearned,
2926	Her agitation and distress
2927	Aroused in him some tenderness.
2928	He bowed to her nor silence broke,
2929	But somehow there shone in his look
2930	The witching light of sympathy;
2931	I know not if his heart felt pain
2932	Or if he meant to flirt again,
2933	From habit or maliciously,
2934	But kindness from his eye had beamed
2935	And to revive Tattiana seemed.The chairs are thrust back with a roar,
2936	The crowd unto the drawing-room speeds,
2937	As bees who leave their dainty store
2938	And seek in buzzing swarms the meads.
2939	Contented and with victuals stored,
2940	Neighbour by neighbour sat and snored,
2941	Matrons unto the fireplace go,
2942	Maids in the corner whisper low;
2943	Behold! green tables are brought forth,
2944	And testy gamesters do engage
2945	In boston and the game of age,
2946	Ombre, and whist all others worth:
2947	A strong resemblance these possess--
2948	All sons of mental weariness.Eight rubbers were already played,
2949	Eight times the heroes of the fight
2950	Change of position had essayed,
2951	When tea was brought. 'Tis my delight
2952	Time to denote by dinner, tea,
2953	And supper. In the country we
2954	Can count the time without much fuss--
2955	The stomach doth admonish us.
2956	And, by the way, I here assert
2957	That for that matter in my verse
2958	As many dinners I rehearse,
2959	As oft to meat and drink advert,
2960	As thou, great Homer, didst of yore,
2961	Whom thirty centuries adore.I will with thy divinity
2962	Contend with knife and fork and platter,
2963	But grant with magnanimity
2964	I'm beaten in another matter;
2965	Thy heroes, sanguinary wights,
2966	Also thy rough-and-tumble fights,
2967	Thy Venus and thy Jupiter,
2968	More advantageously appear
2969	Than cold Oneguine's oddities,
2970	The aspect of a landscape drear.
2971	Or e'en Istomina, my dear,
2972	And fashion's gay frivolities;
2973	But my Tattiana, on my soul,
2974	Is sweeter than thy Helen foul.No one the contrary will urge,
2975	Though for his Helen Menelaus
2976	Again a century should scourge
2977	Us, and like Trojan warriors slay us;
2978	Though around honoured Priam's throne
2979	Troy's sages should in concert own
2980	Once more, when she appeared in sight,
2981	Paris and Menelaus right.
2982	But as to fighting--'twill appear!
2983	For patience, reader, I must plead!
2984	A little farther please to read
2985	And be not in advance severe.
2986	There'll be a fight. I do not lie.
2987	My word of honour given have I.The tea, as I remarked, appeared,
2988	But scarce had maids their saucers ta'en
2989	When in the grand saloon was heard
2990	Of bassoons and of flutes the strain.
2991	His soul by crash of music fired,
2992	His tea with rum no more desired,
2993	The Paris of those country parts
2994	To Olga Petoushkova darts:
2995	To Tania Lenski; Kharlikova,
2996	A marriageable maid matured,
2997	The poet from Tamboff secured,
2998	Bouyanoff whisked off Poustiakova.
2999	All to the grand saloon are gone--
3000	The ball in all its splendour shone.I tried when I began this tale,,
3001	A ball in Peter's capital,
3002	To sketch ye in Albano's style.
3003	But by fantastic dreams distraught,
3004	My memory wandered wide and sought
3005	The feet of my dear lady friends.
3006	O feet, where'er your path extends
3007	I long enough deceived have erred.
3008	The perfidies I recollect
3009	Should make me much more circumspect,
3010	Reform me both in deed and word,
3011	And this fifth canto ought to be
3012	From such digressions wholly free.
3013	The whirlwind of the waltz sweeps by,
3014	Undeviating and insane
3015	As giddy youth's hilarity--
3016	Pair after pair the race sustain.
3017	The moment for revenge, meanwhile,
3018	Espying, Eugene with a smile
3019	Approaches Olga and the pair
3020	Amid the company career.
3021	Soon the maid on a chair he seats,
3022	Begins to talk of this and that,
3023	But when two minutes she had sat,
3024	Again the giddy waltz repeats.
3025	All are amazed; but Lenski he
3026	Scarce credits what his eyes can see.Hark! the mazurka. In times past,
3027	When the mazurka used to peal,
3028	All rattled in the ball-room vast,
3029	The parquet cracked beneath the heel,
3030	And jolting jarred the window-frames.
3031	'Tis not so now. Like gentle dames
3032	We glide along a floor of wax.
3033	However, the mazurka lacks
3034	Nought of its charms original
3035	In country towns, where still it keeps
3036	Its stamping, capers and high leaps.
3037	Fashion is there immutable,
3038	Who tyrannizes us with ease,
3039	Of modern Russians the disease.Bouyanoff, wrathful cousin mine,
3040	Unto the hero of this lay
3041	Olga and Tania led. Malign,
3042	Oneguine Olga bore away.
3043	Gliding in negligent career,
3044	He bending whispered in her ear
3045	Some madrigal not worth a rush,
3046	And pressed her hand--the crimson blush
3047	Upon her cheek by adulation
3048	Grew brighter still. But Lenski hath
3049	Seen all, beside himself with wrath,
3050	And hot with jealous indignation,
3051	Till the mazurka's close he stays,
3052	Her hand for the cotillon prays.
3053	She fears she cannot.--Cannot? Why?--
3054	She promised Eugene, or she would
3055	With great delight.--O God on high!
3056	Heard he the truth? And thus she could--
3057	And can it be? But late a child
3058	And now a fickle flirt and wild,
3059	Cunning already to display
3060	And well-instructed to betray!
3061	Lenski the stroke could not sustain,
3062	At womankind he growled a curse,
3063	Departed, ordered out his horse
3064	And galloped home. But pistols twain,
3065	A pair of bullets--nought beside--
3066	His fate shall presently decide.
3067	Having remarked Vladimir's flight,
3068	Oneguine, bored to death again,
3069	By Olga stood, dejected quite
3070	And satisfied with vengeance ta'en.
3071	Olga began to long likewise
3072	For Lenski, sought him with her eyes,
3073	And endless the cotillon seemed
3074	As if some troubled dream she dreamed.
3075	'Tis done. To supper they proceed.
3076	Bedding is laid out and to all
3077	Assigned a lodging, from the hall
3078	Up to the attic, and all need
3079	Tranquil repose. Eugene alone
3080	To pass the night at home hath gone.
3081	All slumber. In the drawing-room
3082	Loud snores the cumbrous Poustiakoff
3083	With better half as cumbersome;
3084	Gvozdine, Bouyanoff, Petoushkoff
3085	And Flianoff, somewhat indisposed,
3086	On chairs in the saloon reposed,
3087	Whilst on the floor Monsieur Triquet
3088	In jersey and in nightcap lay.
3089	In Olga's and Tattiana's rooms
3090	Lay all the girls by sleep embraced,
3091	Except one by the window placed
3092	Whom pale Diana's ray illumes--
3093	My poor Tattiana cannot sleep
3094	But stares into the darkness deep.
3095	His visit she had not awaited,
3096	His momentary loving glance
3097	Her inmost soul had penetrated,
3098	And his strange conduct at the dance
3099	With Olga; nor of this appeared
3100	An explanation: she was scared,
3101	Alarmed by jealous agonies:
3102	A hand of ice appeared to seize
3103	Her heart: it seemed a darksome pit
3104	Beneath her roaring opened wide:
3105	"I shall expire," Tattiana cried,
3106	"But death from him will be delight.
3107	I murmur not! Why mournfulness?
3108	He _cannot_ give me happiness."
3109	Haste, haste thy lagging pace, my story!
3110	A new acquaintance we must scan.
3111	There dwells five versts from Krasnogory,
3112	Vladimir's property, a man
3113	Who thrives this moment as I write,
3114	A philosophic anchorite:
3115	Zaretski, once a bully bold,
3116	A gambling troop when he controlled,
3117	Chief rascal, pot-house president,
3118	Now of a family the head,
3119	Simple and kindly and unwed,
3120	True friend, landlord benevolent,
3121	Yea! and a man of honour, lo!
3122	How perfect doth our epoch grow!
3123	Time was the flattering voice of fame,
3124	His ruffian bravery adored,
3125	And true, his pistol's faultless aim
3126	An ace at fifteen paces bored.
3127	But I must add to what I write
3128	That, tipsy once in actual fight,
3129	He from his Kalmuck horse did leap
3130	In mud and mire to wallow deep,
3131	Drunk as a fly; and thus the French
3132	A valuable hostage gained,
3133	A modern Regulus unchained,
3134	Who to surrender did not blench
3135	That every morn at Verrey's cost
3136	Three flasks of wine he might exhaust.
3137	Time was, his raillery was gay,
3138	He loved the simpleton to mock,
3139	To make wise men the idiot play
3140	Openly or 'neath decent cloak.
3141	Yet sometimes this or that deceit
3142	Encountered punishment complete,
3143	And sometimes into snares as well
3144	Himself just like a greenhorn fell.
3145	He could in disputation shine
3146	With pungent or obtuse retort,
3147	At times to silence would resort,
3148	At times talk nonsense with design;
3149	Quarrels among young friends he bred
3150	And to the field of honour led;
3151	Or reconciled them, it may be,
3152	And all the three to breakfast went;
3153	Then he'd malign them secretly
3154	With jest and gossip gaily blent.
3155	_Sed alia tempora_. And bravery
3156	Diminishes as years decline.
3157	But, as I said, Zaretski mine
3158	Beneath acacias, cherry-trees,
3159	From storms protection having sought,
3160	Lived as a really wise man ought,
3161	Like Horace, planted cabbages,
3162	Both ducks and geese in plenty bred
3163	And lessons to his children read.
3164	He was no fool, and Eugene mine,
3165	To friendship making no pretence,
3166	Admired his judgment, which was fine,
3167	Pervaded with much common sense.
3168	He usually was glad to see
3169	The man and liked his company,
3170	So, when he came next day to call,
3171	Was not surprised thereby at all.
3172	But, after mutual compliments,
3173	Zaretski with a knowing grin,
3174	Ere conversation could begin,
3175	The epistle from the bard presents.
3176	Oneguine to the window went
3177	And scanned in silence its content.
3178	It was a cheery, generous
3179	Cartel, or challenge to a fight,
3180	Whereto in language courteous
3181	Lenski his comrade did invite.
3182	Oneguine, by first impulse moved,
3183	Turned and replied as it behoved,
3184	Curtly announcing for the fray
3185	That he was "ready any day."
3186	Zaretski rose, nor would explain,
3187	He cared no longer there to stay,
3188	Had much to do at home that day,
3189	And so departed. But Eugene,
3190	The matter by his conscience tried,
3191	Was with himself dissatisfied.In fact, the subject analysed,
3192	Within that secret court discussed,
3193	In much his conduct stigmatized;
3194	For, from the outset, 'twas unjust
3195	To jest as he had done last eve,
3196	A timid, shrinking love to grieve.
3197	And ought he not to disregard
3198	The poet's madness? for 'tis hard
3199	At eighteen not to play the fool!
3200	Sincerely loving him, Eugene
3201	Assuredly should not have been
3202	Conventionality's dull tool--
3203	Not a mere hot, pugnacious boy,
3204	But man of sense and probity.He might his motives have narrated,
3205	Not bristled up like a wild beast,
3206	He ought to have conciliated
3207	That youthful heart--"But, now at least,
3208	The opportunity is flown.
3209	Besides, a duellist well-known
3210	Hath mixed himself in the affair,
3211	Malicious and a slanderer.
3212	Undoubtedly, disdain alone
3213	Should recompense his idle jeers,
3214	But fools--their calumnies and sneers"--
3215	Behold! the world's opinion!
3216	Our idol, Honour's motive force,
3217	Round which revolves the universe.
3218	Impatient, boiling o'er with wrath,
3219	The bard his answer waits at home,
3220	But lo! his braggart neighbour hath
3221	Triumphant with the answer come.
3222	Now for the jealous youth what joy!
3223	He feared the criminal might try
3224	To treat the matter as a jest,
3225	Use subterfuge, and thus his breast
3226	From the dread pistol turn away.
3227	But now all doubt was set aside,
3228	Unto the windmill he must ride
3229	To-morrow before break of day,
3230	To cock the pistol; barrel bend
3231	On thigh or temple, friend on friend.Resolved the flirt to cast away,
3232	The foaming Lenski would refuse,
3233	To see his Olga ere the fray--
3234	His watch, the sun in turn he views--
3235	Finally tost his arms in air
3236	And lo! he is already there!
3237	He deemed his coming would inspire
3238	Olga with trepidation dire.
3239	He was deceived. Just as before
3240	The miserable bard to meet,
3241	As hope uncertain and as sweet,
3242	Olga ran skipping from the door.
3243	She was as heedless and as gay--
3244	Well! just as she was yesterday."Why did you leave last night so soon?"
3245	Was the first question Olga made,
3246	Lenski, into confusion thrown,
3247	All silently hung down his head.
3248	Jealousy and vexation took
3249	To flight before her radiant look,
3250	Before such fond simplicity
3251	And mental elasticity.
3252	He eyed her with a fond concern,
3253	Perceived that he was still beloved,
3254	Already by repentance moved
3255	To ask forgiveness seemed to yearn;
3256	But trembles, words he cannot find,
3257	Delighted, almost sane in mind.But once more pensive and distressed
3258	Beside his Olga doth he grieve,
3259	Nor enough strength of mind possessed
3260	To mention the foregoing eve,
3261	He mused: "I will her saviour be!
3262	With ardent sighs and flattery
3263	The vile seducer shall not dare
3264	The freshness of her heart impair,
3265	Nor shall the caterpillar come
3266	The lily's stem to eat away,
3267	Nor shall the bud of yesterday
3268	Perish when half disclosed its bloom!"--
3269	All this, my friends, translate aright:
3270	"I with my friend intend to fight!"If he had only known the wound
3271	Which rankled in Tattiana's breast,
3272	And if Tattiana mine had found--
3273	If the poor maiden could have guessed
3274	That the two friends with morning's light
3275	Above the yawning grave would fight,--
3276	Ah! it may be, affection true
3277	Had reconciled the pair anew!
3278	But of this love, e'en casually,
3279	As yet none had discovered aught;
3280	Eugene of course related nought,
3281	Tattiana suffered secretly;
3282	Her nurse, who could have made a guess,
3283	Was famous for thick-headedness.Lenski that eve in thought immersed,
3284	Now gloomy seemed and cheerful now,
3285	But he who by the Muse was nursed
3286	Is ever thus. With frowning brow
3287	To the pianoforte he moves
3288	And various chords upon it proves,
3289	Then, eyeing Olga, whispers low:
3290	"I'm happy, say, is it not so?"--
3291	But it grew late; he must not stay;
3292	Heavy his heart with anguish grew;
3293	To the young girl he said adieu,
3294	As it were, tore himself away.
3295	Gazing into his face, she said:
3296	"What ails thee?"--"Nothing."--He is fled.At home arriving he addressed
3297	His care unto his pistols' plight,
3298	Replaced them in their box, undressed
3299	And Schiller read by candlelight.
3300	But one thought only filled his mind,
3301	His mournful heart no peace could find,
3302	Olga he sees before his eyes
3303	Miraculously fair arise,
3304	Vladimir closes up his book,
3305	And grasps a pen: his verse, albeit
3306	With lovers' rubbish filled, was neat
3307	And flowed harmoniously. He took
3308	And spouted it with lyric fire--
3309	Like D when dinner doth inspire.Destiny hath preserved his lay.
3310	I have it. Lo! the very thing!
3311	"Oh! whither have ye winged your way,
3312	Ye golden days of my young spring?
3313	What will the coming dawn reveal?
3314	In vain my anxious eyes appeal;
3315	In mist profound all yet is hid.
3316	So be it! Just the laws which bid
3317	The fatal bullet penetrate,
3318	Or innocently past me fly.
3319	Good governs all! The hour draws nigh
3320	Of life or death predestinate.
3321	Blest be the labours of the light,
3322	And blest the shadows of the night."To-morrow's dawn will glimmer gray,
3323	Bright day will then begin to burn,
3324	But the dark sepulchre I may
3325	Have entered never to return.
3326	The memory of the bard, a dream,
3327	Will be absorbed by Lethe's stream;
3328	Men will forget me, but my urn
3329	To visit, lovely maid, return,
3330	O'er my remains to drop a tear,
3331	And think: here lies who loved me well,
3332	For consecrate to me he fell
3333	In the dawn of existence drear.
3334	Maid whom my heart desires alone,
3335	Approach, approach; I am thine own."Thus in a style _obscure_ and _stale_,
3336	He wrote ('tis the romantic style,
3337	Though of romance therein I fail
3338	To see aught--never mind meanwhile)
3339	And about dawn upon his breast
3340	His weary head declined at rest,
3341	For o'er a word to fashion known,
3342	"Ideal," he had drowsy grown.
3343	But scarce had sleep's soft witchery
3344	Subdued him, when his neighbour stept
3345	Into the chamber where he slept
3346	And wakened him with the loud cry:
3347	"'Tis time to get up! Seven doth strike.
3348	Oneguine waits on us, 'tis like."
3349	He was in error; for Eugene
3350	Was sleeping then a sleep like death;
3351	The pall of night was growing thin,
3352	To Lucifer the cock must breathe
3353	His song, when still he slumbered deep,
3354	The sun had mounted high his steep,
3355	A passing snowstorm wreathed away
3356	With pallid light, but Eugene lay
3357	Upon his couch insensibly;
3358	Slumber still o'er him lingering flies.
3359	But finally he oped his eyes
3360	And turned aside the drapery;
3361	He gazed upon the clock which showed
3362	He long should have been on the road.He rings in haste; in haste arrives
3363	His Frenchman, good Monsieur Guillot,
3364	Who dressing-gown and slippers gives
3365	And linen on him doth bestow.
3366	Dressing as quickly as he can,
3367	Eugene directs the trusty man
3368	To accompany him and to escort
3369	A box of terrible import.
3370	Harnessed the rapid sledge arrived:
3371	He enters: to the mill he drives:
3372	Descends, the order Guillot gives,
3373	The fatal tubes Lepage contrived
3374	To bring behind: the triple steeds
3375	To two young oaks the coachman leads.
3376	Lenski the foeman's apparition
3377	Leaning against the dam expects,
3378	Zaretski, village mechanician,
3379	In the meantime the mill inspects.
3380	Oneguine his excuses says;
3381	"But," cried Zaretski in amaze,
3382	"Your second you have left behind!"
3383	A duellist of classic mind,
3384	Method was dear unto his heart
3385	He would not that a man ye slay
3386	In a lax or informal way,
3387	But followed the strict rules of art,
3388	And ancient usages observed
3389	."My second!" cried in turn Eugene,
3390	"Behold my friend Monsieur Guillot;
3391	To this arrangement can be seen,
3392	No obstacle of which I know.
3393	Although unknown to fame mayhap,
3394	He's a straightforward little chap."
3395	Zaretski bit his lip in wrath,
3396	But to Vladimir Eugene saith:
3397	"Shall we commence?"--"Let it be so,"
3398	Lenski replied, and soon they be
3399	Behind the mill. Meantime ye see
3400	Zaretski and Monsieur Guillot
3401	In consultation stand aside--
3402	The foes with downcast eyes abide.Foes! Is it long since friendship rent
3403	Asunder was and hate prepared?
3404	Since leisure was together spent,
3405	Meals, secrets, occupations shared?
3406	Now, like hereditary foes,
3407	Malignant fury they disclose,
3408	As in some frenzied dream of fear
3409	These friends cold-bloodedly draw near
3410	Mutual destruction to contrive.
3411	Cannot they amicably smile
3412	Ere crimson stains their hands defile,
3413	Depart in peace and friendly live?
3414	But fashionable hatred's flame
3415	Trembles at artificial shame.The shining pistols are uncased,
3416	The mallet loud the ramrod strikes,
3417	Bullets are down the barrels pressed,
3418	For the first time the hammer clicks.
3419	Lo! poured in a thin gray cascade,
3420	The powder in the pan is laid,
3421	The sharp flint, screwed securely on,
3422	Is cocked once more. Uneasy grown,
3423	Guillot behind a pollard stood;
3424	Aside the foes their mantles threw,
3425	Zaretski paces thirty-two
3426	Measured with great exactitude.
3427	At each extreme one takes his stand,
3428	A loaded pistol in his hand."Advance!"--
3429	    Indifferent and sedate,
3430	The foes, as yet not taking aim,
3431	With measured step and even gait
3432	Athwart the snow four paces came--
3433	Four deadly paces do they span;
3434	Oneguine slowly then began
3435	To raise his pistol to his eye,
3436	Though he advanced unceasingly.
3437	And lo! five paces more they pass,
3438	And Lenski, closing his left eye,
3439	Took aim--but as immediately
3440	Oneguine fired--Alas! alas!
3441	The poet's hour hath sounded--See!
3442	He drops his pistol silently.He on his bosom gently placed
3443	His hand, and fell. His clouded eye
3444	Not agony, but death expressed.
3445	So from the mountain lazily
3446	The avalanche of snow first bends,
3447	Then glittering in the sun descends.
3448	The cold sweat bursting from his brow,
3449	To the youth Eugene hurried now--
3450	Gazed on him, called him. Useless care!
3451	He was no more! The youthful bard
3452	For evermore had disappeared.
3453	The storm was hushed. The blossom fair
3454	Was withered ere the morning light--
3455	The altar flame was quenched in night.Tranquil he lay, and strange to view
3456	The peace which on his forehead beamed,
3457	His breast was riddled through and through,
3458	The blood gushed from the wound and steamed
3459	Ere this but one brief moment beat
3460	That heart with inspiration sweet
3461	And enmity and hope and love--
3462	The blood boiled and the passions strove.
3463	Now, as in a deserted house,
3464	All dark and silent hath become;
3465	The inmate is for ever dumb,
3466	The windows whitened, shutters close--
3467	Whither departed is the host?
3468	God knows! The very trace is lost.'Tis sweet the foe to aggravate
3469	With epigrams impertinent,
3470	Sweet to behold him obstinate,
3471	His butting horns in anger bent,
3472	The glass unwittingly inspect
3473	And blush to own himself reflect.
3474	Sweeter it is, my friends, if he
3475	Howl like a dolt: 'tis meant for me!
3476	But sweeter still it is to arrange
3477	For him an honourable grave,
3478	At his pale brow a shot to have,
3479	Placed at the customary range;
3480	But home his body to despatch
3481	Can scarce in sweetness be a match.Well, if your pistol ball by chance
3482	The comrade of your youth should strike,
3483	Who by a haughty word or glance
3484	Or any trifle else ye like
3485	You o'er your wine insulted hath--
3486	Or even overcome by wrath
3487	Scornfully challenged you afield--
3488	Tell me, of sentiments concealed
3489	Which in your spirit dominates,
3490	When motionless your gaze beneath
3491	He lies, upon his forehead death,
3492	And slowly life coagulates--
3493	When deaf and silent he doth lie
3494	Heedless of your despairing cry?Eugene, his pistol yet in hand
3495	And with remorseful anguish filled,
3496	Gazing on Lenski's corse did stand--
3497	Zaretski shouted: "Why, he's killed!"--
3498	Killed! at this dreadful exclamation
3499	Oneguine went with trepidation
3500	And the attendants called in haste.
3501	Most carefully Zaretski placed
3502	Within his sledge the stiffened corse,
3503	And hurried home his awful freight.
3504	Conscious of death approximate,
3505	Loud paws the earth each panting horse,
3506	His bit with foam besprinkled o'er,
3507	And homeward like an arrow tore.My friends, the poet ye regret!
3508	When hope's delightful flower but bloomed
3509	In bud of promise incomplete,
3510	The manly toga scarce assumed,
3511	He perished. Where his troubled dreams,
3512	And where the admirable streams
3513	Of youthful impulse, reverie,
3514	Tender and elevated, free?
3515	And where tempestuous love's desires,
3516	The thirst of knowledge and of fame,
3517	Horror of sinfulness and shame,
3518	Imagination's sacred fires,
3519	Ye shadows of a life more high,
3520	Ye dreams of heavenly poesy?Perchance to benefit mankind,
3521	Or but for fame he saw the light;
3522	His lyre, to silence now consigned,
3523	Resounding through all ages might
3524	Have echoed to eternity.
3525	With worldly honours, it may be,
3526	Fortune the poet had repaid.
3527	It may be that his martyred shade
3528	Carried a truth divine away;
3529	That, for the century designed,
3530	Had perished a creative mind,
3531	And past the threshold of decay,
3532	He ne'er shall hear Time's eulogy,
3533	The blessings of humanity.Or, it may be, the bard had passed
3534	A life in common with the rest;
3535	Vanished his youthful years at last,
3536	The fire extinguished in his breast,
3537	In many things had changed his life--
3538	The Muse abandoned, ta'en a wife,
3539	Inhabited the country, clad
3540	In dressing-gown, a cuckold glad:
3541	A life of fact, not fiction, led--
3542	At forty suffered from the gout,
3543	Eaten, drunk, gossiped and grown stout:
3544	And finally, upon his bed
3545	Had finished life amid his sons,
3546	Doctors and women, sobs and groans.But, howsoe'er his lot were cast,
3547	Alas! the youthful lover slain,
3548	Poetical enthusiast,
3549	A friendly hand thy life hath ta'en!
3550	There is a spot the village near
3551	Where dwelt the Muses' worshipper,
3552	Two pines have joined their tangled roots,
3553	A rivulet beneath them shoots
3554	Its waters to the neighbouring vale.
3555	There the tired ploughman loves to lie,
3556	The reaping girls approach and ply
3557	Within its wave the sounding pail,
3558	And by that shady rivulet
3559	A simple tombstone hath been set.There, when the rains of spring we mark
3560	Upon the meadows showering,
3561	The shepherd plaits his shoe of bark,
3562	Of Volga fishermen doth sing,
3563	And the young damsel from the town,
3564	For summer to the country flown,
3565	Whene'er across the plain at speed
3566	Alone she gallops on her steed,
3567	Stops at the tomb in passing by;
3568	The tightened leathern rein she draws,
3569	Aside she casts her veil of gauze
3570	And reads with rapid eager eye
3571	The simple epitaph--a tear
3572	Doth in her gentle eye appear.
3573	And meditative from the spot
3574	She leisurely away doth ride,
3575	Spite of herself with Lenski's lot
3576	Longtime her mind is occupied.
3577	She muses: "What was Olga's fate?
3578	Longtime was her heart desolate
3579	Or did her tears soon cease to flow?
3580	And where may be her sister now?
3581	Where is the outlaw, banned by men,
3582	Of fashionable dames the foe,
3583	The misanthrope of gloomy brow,
3584	By whom the youthful bard was slain?"--
3585	In time I'll give ye without fail
3586	A true account and in detail.But not at present, though sincerely
3587	I on my chosen hero dote;
3588	Though I'll return to him right early,
3589	Just at this moment I cannot.
3590	Years have inclined me to stern prose,
3591	Years to light rhyme themselves oppose,
3592	And now, I mournfully confess,
3593	In rhyming I show laziness.
3594	As once, to fill the rapid page
3595	My pen no longer finds delight,
3596	Other and colder thoughts affright,
3597	Sterner solicitudes engage,
3598	In worldly din or solitude
3599	Upon my visions such intrude.Fresh aspirations I have known,
3600	I am acquainted with fresh care,
3601	Hopeless are all the first, I own,
3602	Yet still remains the old despair.
3603	Illusions, dream, where, where your sweetness?
3604	Where youth ?
3605	And is it true her garland bright
3606	At last is shrunk and withered quite?
3607	And is it true and not a jest,
3608	Not even a poetic phrase,
3609	That vanished are my youthful days,
3610	Never for me to reappear--
3611	That soon I reach my thirtieth year?And so my noon hath come! If so,
3612	I must resign myself, in sooth;
3613	Yet let us part in friendship, O
3614	My frivolous and jolly youth.
3615	I thank thee for thy joyfulness,
3616	Love's tender transports and distress,
3617	For riot, frolics, mighty feeds,
3618	And all that from thy hand proceeds--
3619	I thank thee. In thy company,
3620	With tumult or contentment still
3621	Of thy delights I drank my fill,
3622	Enough! with tranquil spirit I
3623	Commence a new career in life
3624	And rest from bygone days of strife.But pause! Thou calm retreats, farewell,
3625	Where my days in the wilderness
3626	Of languor and of love did tell
3627	And contemplative dreaminess;
3628	And thou, youth's early inspiration,
3629	Invigorate imagination
3630	And spur my spirit's torpid mood!
3631	Fly frequent to my solitude,
3632	Let not the poet's spirit freeze,
3633	Grow harsh and cruel, dead and dry,
3634	Eventually petrify
3635	In the world's mortal revelries,
3636	Amid the soulless sons of pride
3637	And glittering simpletons beside;Amid sly, pusillanimous
3638	Spoiled children most degenerate
3639	And tiresome rogues ridiculous
3640	And stupid censors passionate;
3641	Amid coquettes who pray to God
3642	And abject slaves who kiss the rod;
3643	In haunts of fashion where each day
3644	All with urbanity betray,
3645	Where harsh frivolity proclaims
3646	Its cold unfeeling sentences;
3647	Amid the awful emptiness
3648	Of conversation, thought and aims--
3649	In that morass where you and I
3650	Wallow, my friends, in company!
3651	Moscow
3652	Moscow, Russia's darling daughter,
3653	Where thine equal shall we find?
3654	                    Dmitrieff
3655	Who can help loving mother Moscow?
3656	            Baratynski
3657	A journey to Moscow! To see the world!
3658	Where better?
3659	        Where man is not.
3660	    Griboyedoff
3661	Impelled by Spring's dissolving beams,
3662	The snows from off the hills around
3663	Descended swift in turbid streams
3664	And flooded all the level ground.
3665	A smile from slumbering nature clear
3666	Did seem to greet the youthful year;
3667	The heavens shone in deeper blue,
3668	The woods, still naked to the view,
3669	Seemed in a haze of green embowered.
3670	The bee forth from his cell of wax
3671	Flew to collect his rural tax;
3672	The valleys dried and gaily flowered;
3673	Herds low, and under night's dark veil
3674	Already sings the nightingale.
3675	Mournful is thine approach to me,
3676	O Spring, thou chosen time of love!
3677	What agitation languidly
3678	My spirit and my blood doth move,
3679	What sad emotions o'er me steal
3680	When first upon my cheek I feel
3681	The breath of Spring again renewed,
3682	Secure in rural quietude--
3683	Or, strange to me is happiness?
3684	Do all things which to mirth incline.
3685	And make a dark existence shine
3686	Inflict annoyance and distress
3687	Upon a soul inert and cloyed?--
3688	And is all light within destroyed?
3689	Or, heedless of the leaves' return
3690	Which Autumn late to earth consigned,
3691	Do we alone our losses mourn
3692	Of which the rustling woods remind?
3693	Or, when anew all Nature teems,
3694	Do we foresee in troubled dreams
3695	The coming of life's Autumn drear.
3696	For which no springtime shall appear?
3697	Or, it may be, we inly seek,
3698	Wafted upon poetic wing,
3699	Some other long-departed Spring,
3700	Whose memories make the heart beat quick
3701	With thoughts of a far distant land,
3702	Of a strange night when the moon and--
3703	'Tis now the season! Idlers all,
3704	Epicurean philosophers,
3705	Ye men of fashion cynical,
3706	Of Levshin's school ye followers,
3707	Priams of country populations
3708	And dames of fine organisations,
3709	Spring summons you to her green bowers,
3710	'Tis the warm time of labour, flowers;
3711	The time for mystic strolls which late
3712	Into the starry night extend.
3713	Quick to the country let us wend
3714	In vehicles surcharged with freight;
3715	In coach or post-cart duly placed
3716	Beyond the city-barriers haste.Thou also, reader generous,
3717	The chaise long ordered please employ,
3718	Abandon cities riotous,
3719	Which in the winter were a joy:
3720	The Muse capricious let us coax,
3721	Go hear the rustling of the oaks
3722	Beside a nameless rivulet,
3723	Where in the country Eugene yet,
3724	An idle anchorite and sad,
3725	A while ago the winter spent,
3726	Near young Tattiana resident,
3727	My pretty self-deceiving maid--
3728	No more the village knows his face,
3729	For there he left a mournful trace.
3730	Let us proceed unto a rill,
3731	Which in a hilly neighbourhood
3732	Seeks, winding amid meadows still,
3733	The river through the linden wood.
3734	The nightingale there all night long,
3735	Spring's paramour, pours forth her song
3736	The fountain brawls, sweetbriers bloom,
3737	And lo! where lies a marble tomb
3738	And two old pines their branches spread--
3739	"_Vladimir Lenski lies beneath,
3740	Who early died a gallant death_,"
3741	Thereon the passing traveller read:
3742	"_The date, his fleeting years how long--
3743	Repose in peace, thou child of song_."
3744	Time was, the breath of early dawn
3745	Would agitate a mystic wreath
3746	Hung on a pine branch earthward drawn
3747	Above the humble urn of death.
3748	Time was, two maidens from their home
3749	At eventide would hither come,
3750	And, by the light the moonbeams gave,
3751	Lament, embrace upon that grave.
3752	But now--none heeds the monument
3753	Of woe: effaced the pathway now:
3754	There is no wreath upon the bough:
3755	Alone beside it, gray and bent,
3756	As formerly the shepherd sits
3757	And his poor basten sandal knits.
3758	My poor Vladimir, bitter tears
3759	Thee but a little space bewept,
3760	Faithless, alas! thy maid appears,
3761	Nor true unto her sorrow kept.
3762	Another could her heart engage,
3763	Another could her woe assuage
3764	By flattery and lover's art--
3765	A lancer captivates her heart!
3766	A lancer her soul dotes upon:
3767	Before the altar, lo! the pair,
3768	Mark ye with what a modest air
3769	She bows her head beneath the crown;
3770	Behold her downcast eyes which glow,
3771	Her lips where light smiles come and go!
3772	My poor Vladimir! In the tomb,
3773	Passed into dull eternity,
3774	Was the sad poet filled with gloom,
3775	Hearing the fatal perfidy?
3776	Or, beyond Lethe lulled to rest,
3777	Hath the bard, by indifference blest,
3778	Callous to all on earth become--
3779	Is the world to him sealed and dumb?
3780	The same unmoved oblivion
3781	On us beyond the grave attends,
3782	The voice of lovers, foes and friends,
3783	Dies suddenly: of heirs alone
3784	Remains on earth the unseemly rage,
3785	Whilst struggling for the heritage.Soon Olga's accents shrill resound
3786	No longer through her former home;
3787	The lancer, to his calling bound,
3788	Back to his regiment must roam.
3789	The aged mother, bathed in tears,
3790	Distracted by her grief appears
3791	When the hour came to bid good-bye--
3792	But my Tattiana's eyes were dry.
3793	Only her countenance assumed
3794	A deadly pallor, air distressed;
3795	When all around the entrance pressed,
3796	To say farewell, and fussed and fumed
3797	Around the carriage of the pair--
3798	Tattiana gently led them there.And long her eyes as through a haze
3799	After the wedded couple strain;
3800	Alas! the friend of childish days
3801	Away, Tattiana, hath been ta'en.
3802	Thy dove, thy darling little pet
3803	On whom a sister's heart was set
3804	Afar is borne by cruel fate,
3805	For evermore is separate.
3806	She wanders aimless as a sprite,
3807	Into the tangled garden goes
3808	But nowhere can she find repose,
3809	Nor even tears afford respite,
3810	Of consolation all bereft--
3811	Well nigh her heart in twain was cleft.In cruel solitude each day
3812	With flame more ardent passion burns,
3813	And to Oneguine far away
3814	Her heart importunately turns.
3815	She never more his face may view,
3816	For was it not her duty to
3817	Detest him for a brother slain?
3818	The poet fell; already men
3819	No more remembered him; unto
3820	Another his betrothed was given;
3821	The memory of the bard was driven
3822	Like smoke athwart the heaven blue;
3823	Two hearts perchance were desolate
3824	And mourned him still. Why mourn his fate?'Twas eve. 'Twas dusk. The river speeds
3825	In tranquil flow. The beetle hums.
3826	Already dance to song proceeds;
3827	The fisher's fire afar illumes
3828	The river's bank. Tattiana lone
3829	Beneath the silver of the moon
3830	Long time in meditation deep
3831	Her path across the plain doth keep--
3832	Proceeds, until she from a hill
3833	Sees where a noble mansion stood,
3834	A village and beneath, a wood,
3835	A garden by a shining rill.
3836	She gazed thereon, and instant beat
3837	Her heart more loudly and more fleet.She hesitates, in doubt is thrown--
3838	"Shall I proceed, or homeward flee?
3839	He is not there: I am not known:
3840	The house and garden I would see."
3841	Tattiana from the hill descends
3842	With bated breath, around she bends
3843	A countenance perplexed and scared.
3844	She enters a deserted yard--
3845	Yelping, a pack of dogs rush out,
3846	But at her shriek ran forth with noise
3847	The household troop of little boys,
3848	Who with a scuffle and a shout
3849	The curs away to kennel chase,
3850	The damsel under escort place."Can I inspect the mansion, please?"
3851	Tattiana asks, and hurriedly
3852	Unto Anicia for the keys
3853	The family of children hie.
3854	Anicia soon appears, the door
3855	Opens unto her visitor.
3856	Into the lonely house she went,
3857	Wherein a space Oneguine spent.
3858	She gazed--a cue, forgotten long,
3859	Doth on the billiard table rest,
3860	Upon the tumbled sofa placed,
3861	A riding whip. She strolls along.
3862	The beldam saith: "The hearth, by it
3863	The master always used to sit."Departed Lenski here to dine
3864	In winter time would often come.
3865	Please follow this way, lady mine,
3866	This is my master's sitting-room.
3867	'Tis here he slept, his coffee took,
3868	Into accounts would sometimes look,
3869	A book at early morn perused.
3870	The room my former master used.
3871	On Sundays by yon window he,
3872	Spectacles upon nose, all day
3873	Was wont with me at cards to play.
3874	God save his soul eternally
3875	And grant his weary bones their rest
3876	Deep in our mother Earth's chill breast!"Tattiana's eyes with tender gleam
3877	On everything around her gaze,
3878	Of priceless value all things seem
3879	And in her languid bosom raise
3880	A pleasure though with sorrow knit:
3881	The table with its lamp unlit,
3882	The pile of books, with carpet spread
3883	Beneath the window-sill his bed,
3884	The landscape which the moonbeams fret,
3885	The twilight pale which softens all,
3886	Lord Byron's portrait on the wall
3887	And the cast-iron statuette
3888	With folded arms and eyes bent low,
3889	Cocked hat and melancholy brow.
3890	Long in this fashionable cell
3891	Tattiana as enchanted stood;
3892	But it grew late; cold blew the gale;
3893	Dark was the valley and the wood
3894	Slept o'er the river misty grown.
3895	Behind the mountain sank the moon.
3896	Long, long the hour had past when home
3897	Our youthful wanderer should roam.
3898	She hid the trouble of her breast,
3899	Heaved an involuntary sigh
3900	And turned to leave immediately,
3901	But first permission did request
3902	Thither in future to proceed
3903	That certain volumes she might read.Adieu she to the matron said
3904	At the front gates, but in brief space
3905	At early morn returns the maid
3906	To the abandoned dwelling-place.
3907	When in the study's calm retreat,
3908	Wrapt in oblivion complete,
3909	She found herself alone at last,
3910	Longtime her tears flowed thick and fast;
3911	But presently she tried to read;
3912	At first for books was disinclined,
3913	But soon their choice seemed to her mind
3914	Remarkable. She then indeed
3915	Devoured them with an eager zest.
3916	A new world was made manifest!Although we know that Eugene had
3917	Long ceased to be a reading man,
3918	Still certain authors, I may add,
3919	He had excepted from the ban:
3920	The bard of Juan and the Giaour,
3921	With it may be a couple more;
3922	Romances three, in which ye scan
3923	Portrayed contemporary man
3924	As the reflection of his age,
3925	His immorality of mind
3926	To arid selfishness resigned,
3927	A visionary personage
3928	With his exasperated sense,
3929	His energy and impotence.And numerous pages had preserved
3930	The sharp incisions of his nail,
3931	And these the attentive maid observed
3932	With eye precise and without fail.
3933	Tattiana saw with trepidation
3934	By what idea or observation
3935	Oneguine was the most impressed,
3936	In what he merely acquiesced.
3937	Upon those margins she perceived
3938	Oneguine's pencillings. His mind
3939	Made revelations undesigned,
3940	Of what he thought and what believed,
3941	A dagger, asterisk, or note
3942	Interrogation to denote.And my Tattiana now began
3943	To understand by slow degrees
3944	More clearly, God be praised, the man,
3945	Whom autocratic fate's decrees
3946	Had bid her sigh for without hope--
3947	A dangerous, gloomy misanthrope,
3948	Being from hell or heaven sent,
3949	Angel or fiend malevolent.
3950	Which is he? or an imitation,
3951	A bogy conjured up in joke,
3952	A Russian in Childe Harold's cloak,
3953	Of foreign whims the impersonation--
3954	Handbook of fashionable phrase
3955	Or parody of modern ways?Hath she found out the riddle yet?
3956	Hath she a fitting phrase selected?
3957	But time flies and she doth forget
3958	They long at home have her expected--
3959	Whither two neighbouring dames have walked
3960	And a long time about her talked.
3961	"What can be done? She is no child!"
3962	Cried the old dame with anguish filled:
3963	"Olinka is her junior, see.
3964	'Tis time to marry her, 'tis true,
3965	But tell me what am I to do?
3966	To all she answers cruelly--
3967	I will not wed, and ever weeps
3968	And lonely through the forest creeps.""Is she in love?" quoth one. "With whom?
3969	Bouyanoff courted. She refused.
3970	Petoushkoff met the selfsame doom.
3971	The hussar Pykhtin was accused.
3972	How the young imp on Tania doted!
3973	To captivate her how devoted!
3974	I mused: perhaps the matter's squared--
3975	O yes! my hopes soon disappeared."
3976	"But, _matushka_, to Moscow you
3977	Should go, the market for a maid,
3978	With many a vacancy, 'tis said."--
3979	"Alas! my friend, no revenue!"
3980	"Enough to see one winter's end;
3981	If not, the money I will lend."
3982	The venerable dame opined
3983	The counsel good and full of reason,
3984	Her money counted, and designed
3985	To visit Moscow in the season.
3986	Tattiana learns the intelligence--
3987	Of her provincial innocence
3988	The unaffected traits she now
3989	Unto a carping world must show--
3990	Her toilette's antiquated style,
3991	Her antiquated mode of speech,
3992	For Moscow fops and Circes each
3993	To mark with a contemptuous smile.
3994	Horror! had she not better stay
3995	Deep in the greenwood far away?Arising with the morning's light,
3996	Unto the fields she makes her way,
3997	And with emotional delight
3998	Surveying them, she thus doth say:
3999	"Ye peaceful valleys all, good-bye!
4000	Ye well-known mountain summits high,
4001	Ye groves whose depths I know so well,
4002	Thou beauteous sky above, farewell!
4003	Delicious nature, thee I fly,
4004	The calm existence which I prize
4005	I yield for splendid vanities,
4006	Thou too farewell, my liberty!
4007	Whither and wherefore do I speed
4008	And what will Destiny concede?"Farther Tattiana's walks extend--
4009	'Tis now the hillock now the rill
4010	Their natural attractions lend
4011	To stay the maid against her will.
4012	She the acquaintances she loves,
4013	Her spacious fields and shady groves,
4014	Another visit hastes to pay.
4015	But Summer swiftly fades away
4016	And golden Autumn draweth nigh,
4017	And pallid nature trembling grieves,
4018	A victim decked with golden leaves;
4019	Dark clouds before the north wind fly;
4020	It blew: it howled: till winter e'en
4021	Came forth in all her magic sheen.The snow descends and buries all,
4022	Hangs heavy on the oaken boughs,
4023	A white and undulating pall
4024	O'er hillock and o'er meadow throws.
4025	The channel of the river stilled
4026	As if with eider-down is filled.
4027	The hoar-frost glitters: all rejoice
4028	In mother Winter's strange caprice.
4029	But Tania's heart is not at ease,
4030	Winter's approach she doth not hail
4031	Nor the frost particles inhale
4032	Nor the first snow of winter seize
4033	Her shoulders, breast and face to lave--
4034	Alarm the winter journey gave.The date was fixed though oft postponed,
4035	But ultimately doth approach.
4036	Examined, mended, newly found
4037	Was the old and forgotten coach;
4038	Kibitkas three, the accustomed train,
4039	The household property contain:
4040	Saucepans and mattresses and chairs,
4041	Portmanteaus and preserves in jars,
4042	Feather-beds, also poultry-coops,
4043	Basins and jugs--well! everything
4044	To happiness contributing.
4045	Behold! beside their dwelling groups
4046	Of serfs the farewell wail have given.
4047	Nags eighteen to the door are driven.
4048	These to the coach of state are bound,
4049	Breakfast the busy cooks prepare,
4050	Baggage is heaped up in a mound,
4051	Old women at the coachmen swear.
4052	A bearded postillion astride
4053	A lean and shaggy nag doth ride,
4054	Unto the gates the servants fly
4055	To bid the gentlefolk good-bye.
4056	These take their seats; the coach of state
4057	Leisurely through the gateway glides.
4058	"Adieu! thou home where peace abides,
4059	Where turmoil cannot penetrate,
4060	Shall I behold thee once again?"--
4061	Tattiana tears cannot restrain.The limits of enlightenment
4062	When to enlarge we shall succeed,
4063	In course of time (the whole extent
4064	Will not five centuries exceed
4065	By computation) it is like
4066	Our roads transformed the eye will strike;
4067	Highways all Russia will unite
4068	And form a network left and right;
4069	On iron bridges we shall gaze
4070	Which o'er the waters boldly leap,
4071	Mountains we'll level and through deep
4072	Streams excavate subaqueous ways,
4073	And Christian folk will, I expect,
4074	An inn at every stage erect.But now, what wretched roads one sees,
4075	Our bridges long neglected rot,
4076	And at the stages bugs and fleas
4077	One moment's slumber suffer not.
4078	Inns there are none. Pretentious but
4079	Meagre, within a draughty hut,
4080	A bill of fare hangs full in sight
4081	And irritates the appetite.
4082	Meantime a Cyclops of those parts
4083	Before a fire which feebly glows
4084	Mends with the Russian hammer's blows
4085	The flimsy wares of Western marts,
4086	With blessings on the ditches and
4087	The ruts of his own fatherland.Yet on a frosty winter day
4088	The journey in a sledge doth please,
4089	No senseless fashionable lay
4090	Glides with a more luxurious ease;
4091	For our Automedons are fire
4092	And our swift troikas never tire;
4093	The verst posts catch the vacant eye
4094	And like a palisade flit by.
4095	The Larinas unwisely went,
4096	From apprehension of the cost,
4097	By their own horses, not the post--
4098	So Tania to her heart's content
4099	Could taste the pleasures of the road.
4100	Seven days and nights the travellers plod.
4101	But they draw near. Before them, lo!
4102	White Moscow raises her old spires,
4103	Whose countless golden crosses glow
4104	As with innumerable fires.
4105	Ah! brethren, what was my delight
4106	When I yon semicircle bright
4107	Of churches, gardens, belfries high
4108	Descried before me suddenly!
4109	Moscow, how oft in evil days,
4110	Condemned to exile dire by fate,
4111	On thee I used to meditate!
4112	Moscow! How much is in the phrase
4113	For every loyal Russian breast!
4114	How much is in that word expressed!
4115	Lo! compassed by his grove of oaks,
4116	Petrovski Palace! Gloomily
4117	His recent glory he invokes.
4118	Here, drunk with his late victory,
4119	Napoleon tarried till it please
4120	Moscow approach on bended knees,
4121	Time-honoured Kremlin's keys present.
4122	Not so! My Moscow never went
4123	To seek him out with bended head.
4124	No gift she bears, no feast proclaims,
4125	But lights incendiary flames
4126	For the impatient chief instead.
4127	From hence engrossed in thought profound
4128	He on the conflagration frowned.
4129	Adieu, thou witness of our glory,
4130	Petrovski Palace; come, astir!
4131	Drive on! the city barriers hoary
4132	Appear; along the road of Tver
4133	The coach is borne o'er ruts and holes,
4134	Past women, sentry-boxes, rolls,
4135	Past palaces and nunneries,
4136	Lamp-posts, shops, sledges, families,
4137	Bokharians, peasants, beds of greens,
4138	Boulevards, belfries, milliners,
4139	Huts, chemists, Cossacks, shopkeepers
4140	And fashionable magazines,
4141	Balconies, lion's heads on doors,
4142	Jackdaws on every spire--in scores.
4143	The weary way still incomplete,
4144	An hour passed by--another--till,
4145	Near Khariton's in a side street
4146	The coach before a house stood still.
4147	At an old aunt's they had arrived
4148	Who had for four long years survived
4149	An invalid from lung complaint.
4150	A Kalmuck gray, in caftan rent
4151	And spectacles, his knitting staid
4152	And the saloon threw open wide;
4153	The princess from the sofa cried
4154	And the newcomers welcome bade.
4155	The two old ladies then embraced
4156	And exclamations interlaced."Princesse, mon ange!"--"Pachette!"--
4157	"Aline!"
4158	"Who would have thought it? As of yore!
4159	Is it for long?"--"Ma chere cousine!"
4160	"Sit down. How funny, to be sure!
4161	'Tis a scene of romance, I vow!"
4162	"Tania, my eldest child, you know"--
4163	"Ah! come, Tattiana, come to me!
4164	Is it a dream, and can it be?
4165	Cousin, rememb'rest Grandison?"
4166	"What! Grandison?"--"Yes, certainly!"
4167	"Oh! I remember, where is he?"--
4168	"Here, he resides with Simeon.
4169	He called upon me Christmas Eve--
4170	His son is married, just conceive!""And he--but of him presently--
4171	To-morrow Tania we will show,
4172	What say you? to the family--
4173	Alas! abroad I cannot go.
4174	See, I can hardly crawl about--
4175	But you must both be quite tired out!
4176	Let us go seek a little rest--
4177	Ah! I'm so weak--my throbbing breast!
4178	Oppressive now is happiness,
4179	Not only sorrow--Ah! my dear,
4180	Now I am fit for nothing here.
4181	In old age life is weariness!"
4182	Then weeping she sank back distressed
4183	And fits of coughing racked her chest.By the sick lady's gaiety
4184	And kindness Tania was impressed,
4185	But, her own room in memory,
4186	The strange apartment her oppressed:
4187	Repose her silken curtains fled,
4188	She could not sleep in her new bed.
4189	The early tinkling of the bells
4190	Which of approaching labour tells
4191	Aroused Tattiana from her bed.
4192	The maiden at her casement sits
4193	As daylight glimmers, darkness flits,
4194	But ah! discerns nor wood nor mead--
4195	Beneath her lay a strange courtyard,
4196	A stable, kitchen, fence appeared.To consanguineous dinners they
4197	Conduct Tattiana constantly,
4198	That grandmothers and grandsires may
4199	Contemplate her sad reverie.
4200	We Russians, friends from distant parts
4201	Ever receive with kindly hearts
4202	And exclamations and good cheer.
4203	"How Tania grows! Doth it appear
4204	Long since I held thee at the font--
4205	Since in these arms I thee did bear--
4206	And since I pulled thee by the ear--
4207	And I to give thee cakes was wont?"--
4208	Then the old dames in chorus sing,
4209	"Oh! how our years are vanishing!"But nothing changed in them is seen,
4210	All in the good old style appears,
4211	Our dear old aunt, Princess Helene,
4212	Her cap of tulle still ever wears:
4213	Luceria Lvovna paint applies,
4214	Amy Petrovna  utters lies,
4215	Ivan Petrovitch still a gaby,
4216	Simeon Petrovitch just as shabby;
4217	Pelagie Nikolavna has
4218	Her friend Monsieur Finemouche the same,
4219	Her wolf-dog and her husband tame;
4220	Still of his club he member was--
4221	As deaf and silly doth remain,
4222	Still eats and drinks enough for twain.Their daughters kiss Tattiana fair.
4223	In the beginning, cold and mute,
4224	Moscow's young Graces at her stare,
4225	Examine her from head to foot.
4226	They deem her somewhat finical,
4227	Outlandish and provincial,
4228	A trifle pale, a trifle lean,
4229	But plainer girls they oft had seen.
4230	Obedient then to Nature's law,
4231	With her they did associate,
4232	Squeeze tiny hands and osculate;
4233	Her tresses curled in fashion saw,
4234	And oft in whispers would impart
4235	A maiden's secrets--of the heart.Triumphs--their own or those of friends--
4236	Hopes, frolics, dreams and sentiment
4237	Their harmless conversation blends
4238	With scandal's trivial ornament.
4239	Then to reward such confidence
4240	Her amorous experience
4241	With mute appeal to ask they seem--
4242	But Tania just as in a dream
4243	Without participation hears,
4244	Their voices nought to her impart
4245	And the lone secret of her heart,
4246	Her sacred hoard of joy and tears,
4247	She buries deep within her breast
4248	Nor aught confides unto the rest.Tattiana would have gladly heard
4249	The converse of the world polite,
4250	But in the drawing-room all appeared
4251	To find in gossip such delight,
4252	Speech was so tame and colourless
4253	Their slander e'en was weariness;
4254	In their sterility of prattle,
4255	Questions and news and tittle-tattle,
4256	No sense was ever manifest
4257	Though by an error and unsought--
4258	The languid mind could smile at nought,
4259	Heart would not throb albeit in jest--
4260	Even amusing fools we miss
4261	In thee, thou world of empty bliss.In groups, official striplings glance
4262	Conceitedly on Tania fair,
4263	And views amongst themselves advance
4264	Unfavourable unto her.
4265	But one buffoon unhappy deemed
4266	Her the ideal which he dreamed,
4267	And leaning 'gainst the portal closed
4268	To her an elegy composed.
4269	Also one Viazemski, remarking
4270	Tattiana by a poor aunt's side,
4271	Successfully to please her tried,
4272	And an old gent the poet marking
4273	By Tania, smoothing his peruke,
4274	To ask her name the trouble took.
4275	But where Melpomene doth rave
4276	With lengthened howl and accent loud,
4277	And her bespangled robe doth wave
4278	Before a cold indifferent crowd,
4279	And where Thalia softly dreams
4280	And heedless of approval seems,
4281	Terpsichore alone among
4282	Her sisterhood delights the young
4283	(So 'twas with us in former years,
4284	In your young days and also mine),
4285	Never upon my heroine
4286	The jealous dame her lorgnette veers,
4287	The connoisseur his glances throws
4288	From boxes or from stalls in rows.To the assembly her they bear.
4289	There the confusion, pressure, heat,
4290	The crash of music, candles' glare
4291	And rapid whirl of many feet,
4292	The ladies' dresses airy, light,
4293	The motley moving mass and bright,
4294	Young ladies in a vasty curve,
4295	To strike imagination serve.
4296	'Tis there that arrant fops display
4297	Their insolence and waistcoats white
4298	And glasses unemployed all night;
4299	Thither hussars on leave will stray
4300	To clank the spur, delight the fair--
4301	And vanish like a bird in air.Full many a lovely star hath night
4302	And Moscow many a beauty fair:
4303	Yet clearer shines than every light
4304	The moon in the blue atmosphere.
4305	And she to whom my lyre would fain,
4306	Yet dares not, dedicate its strain,
4307	Shines in the female firmament
4308	Like a full moon magnificent.
4309	Lo! with what pride celestial
4310	Her feet the earth beneath her press!
4311	Her heart how full of gentleness,
4312	Her glance how wild yet genial!
4313	Enough, enough, conclude thy lay--
4314	For folly's dues thou hadst to pay.Noise, laughter, bowing, hurrying mixt,
4315	Gallop, mazurka, waltzing--see!
4316	A pillar by, two aunts betwixt,
4317	Tania, observed by nobody,
4318	Looks upon all with absent gaze
4319	And hates the world's discordant ways.
4320	'Tis noisome to her there: in thought
4321	Again her rural life she sought,
4322	The hamlet, the poor villagers,
4323	The little solitary nook
4324	Where shining runs the tiny brook,
4325	Her garden, and those books of hers,
4326	And the lime alley's twilight dim
4327	Where the first time she met with _him_.Thus widely meditation erred,
4328	Forgot the world, the noisy ball,
4329	Whilst from her countenance ne'er stirred
4330	The eyes of a grave general.
4331	Both aunts looked knowing as a judge,
4332	Each gave Tattiana's arm a nudge
4333	And in a whisper did repeat:
4334	"Look quickly to your left, my sweet!"
4335	"The left? Why, what on earth is there?"--
4336	"No matter, look immediately.
4337	There, in that knot of company,
4338	Two dressed in uniform appear--
4339	Ah! he has gone the other way"--
4340	"Who? Is it that stout general, pray?"--Let us congratulations pay
4341	To our Tattiana conquering,
4342	And for a time our course delay,
4343	That I forget not whom I sing.
4344	Let me explain that in my song
4345	"I celebrate a comrade young
4346	And the extent of his caprice;
4347	O epic Muse, my powers increase
4348	And grant success to labour long;
4349	Having a trusty staff bestowed,
4350	Grant that I err not on the road."
4351	Enough! my pack is now unslung--
4352	To classicism I've homage paid,
4353	Though late, have a beginning made.
4354	The Great World
4355	'Fare thee well, and if for ever,
4356	Still for ever fare thee well.'--Byron
4357	In the Lyceum's noiseless shade
4358	As in a garden when I grew,
4359	I Apuleius gladly read
4360	But would not look at Cicero.
4361	'Twas then in valleys lone, remote,
4362	In spring-time, heard the cygnet's note
4363	By waters shining tranquilly,
4364	That first the Muse appeared to me.
4365	Into the study of the boy
4366	There came a sudden flash of light,
4367	The Muse revealed her first delight,
4368	Sang childhood's pastimes and its joy,
4369	Glory with which our history teems
4370	And the heart's agitated dreams.
4371	And the world met her smilingly,
4372	A first success light pinions gave,
4373	The old Derjavine noticed me,
4374	And blest me, sinking to the grave.
4375	Then my companions young with pleasure
4376	In the unfettered hours of leisure
4377	Her utterances ever heard,
4378	And by a partial temper stirred
4379	And boiling o'er with friendly heat,
4380	They first of all my brow did wreathe
4381	And an encouragement did breathe
4382	That my coy Muse might sing more sweet.
4383	O triumphs of my guileless days,
4384	How sweet a dream your memories raise!
4385	Passion's wild sway I then allowed,
4386	Her promptings unto law did make,
4387	Pursuits I followed of the crowd,
4388	My sportive Muse I used to take
4389	To many a noisy feast and fight,
4390	Terror of guardians of the night;
4391	And wild festivities among
4392	She brought with her the gift of song.
4393	Like a Bacchante in her sport
4394	Beside the cup she sang her rhymes
4395	And the young revellers of past times
4396	Vociferously paid her court,
4397	And I, amid the friendly crowd,
4398	Of my light paramour was proud.
4399	But I abandoned their array,
4400	And fled afar--she followed me.
4401	How oft the kindly Muse away
4402	Hath whiled the road's monotony,
4403	Entranced me by some mystic tale.
4404	How oft beneath the moonbeams pale
4405	Like Leonora did she ride
4406	With me Caucasian rocks beside!
4407	How oft to the Crimean shore
4408	She led me through nocturnal mist
4409	Unto the sounding sea to list,
4410	Where Nereids murmur evermore,
4411	And where the billows hoarsely raise
4412	To God eternal hymns of praise.
4413	Then, the far capital forgot,
4414	Its splendour and its blandishments,
4415	In poor Moldavia cast her lot,
4416	She visited the humble tents
4417	Of migratory gipsy hordes--
4418	And wild among them grew her words--
4419	Our godlike tongue she could exchange
4420	For savage speech, uncouth and strange,
4421	And ditties of the steppe she loved.
4422	But suddenly all changed around!
4423	Lo! in my garden was she found
4424	And as a country damsel roved,
4425	A pensive sorrow in her glance
4426	And in her hand a French romance.
4427	Now for the first time I my Muse
4428	Lead into good society,
4429	Her steppe-like beauties I peruse
4430	With jealous fear, anxiety.
4431	Through dense aristocratic rows
4432	Of diplomats and warlike beaux
4433	And supercilious dames she glides,
4434	Sits down and gazes on all sides--
4435	Amazed at the confusing crowd,
4436	Variety of speech and vests,
4437	Deliberate approach of guests
4438	Who to the youthful hostess bowed,
4439	And the dark fringe of men, like frames
4440	Enclosing pictures of fair dames.
4441	Assemblies oligarchical
4442	Please her by their decorum fixed,
4443	The rigour of cold pride and all
4444	Titles and ages intermixed.
4445	But who in that choice company
4446	With clouded brow stands silently?
4447	Unknown to all he doth appear,
4448	A vision desolate and drear
4449	Doth seem to him the festal scene.
4450	Doth his brow wretchedness declare
4451	Or suffering pride? Why is he there?
4452	Who may he be? Is it Eugene?
4453	Pray is it he? It is the same.
4454	"And is it long since back he came?
4455	"Is he the same or grown more wise?
4456	Still doth the misanthrope appear?
4457	He has returned, say in what guise?
4458	What is his latest character?
4459	What doth he act? Is it Melmoth,
4460	Philanthropist or patriot,
4461	Childe Harold, quaker, devotee,
4462	Or other mask donned playfully?
4463	Or a good fellow for the nonce,
4464	Like you and me and all the rest?--
4465	But this is my advice, 'twere best
4466	Not to behave as he did once--
4467	Society he duped enow."
4468	"Is he known to you?"--"Yes and No."Wherefore regarding him express
4469	Perverse, unfavourable views?
4470	Is it that human restlessness
4471	For ever carps, condemns, pursues?
4472	Is it that ardent souls of flame
4473	By recklessness amuse or shame
4474	Selfish nonentities around?
4475	That mind which yearns for space is bound?
4476	And that too often we receive
4477	Professions eagerly for deeds,
4478	That crass stupidity misleads,
4479	That we by cant ourselves deceive,
4480	That mediocrity alone
4481	Without disgust we look upon?Happy he who in youth was young,
4482	Happy who timely grew mature,
4483	He who life's frosts which early wrung
4484	Hath gradually learnt to endure;
4485	By visions who was ne'er deranged
4486	Nor from the mob polite estranged,
4487	At twenty who was prig or swell,
4488	At thirty who was married well,
4489	At fifty who relief obtained
4490	From public and from private ties,
4491	Who glory, wealth and dignities
4492	Hath tranquilly in turn attained,
4493	And unto whom we all allude
4494	As to a worthy man and good!But sad is the reflection made,
4495	In vain was youth by us received,
4496	That we her constantly betrayed
4497	And she at last hath us deceived;
4498	That our desires which noblest seemed,
4499	The purest of the dreams we dreamed,
4500	Have one by one all withered grown
4501	Like rotten leaves by Autumn strown--
4502	'Tis fearful to anticipate
4503	Nought but of dinners a long row,
4504	To look on life as on a show,
4505	Eternally to imitate
4506	The seemly crowd, partaking nought
4507	Its passions and its modes of thought.The butt of scandal having been,
4508	'Tis dreadful--ye agree, I hope--
4509	To pass with reasonable men
4510	For a fictitious misanthrope,
4511	A visionary mortified,
4512	Or monster of Satanic pride,
4513	Or e'en the "Demon" of my strain.
4514	Oneguine--take him up again--
4515	In duel having killed his friend
4516	And reached, with nought his mind to engage,
4517	The twenty-sixth year of his age,
4518	Wearied of leisure in the end,
4519	Without profession, business, wife,
4520	He knew not how to spend his life.
4521	Him a disquietude did seize,
4522	A wish from place to place to roam,
4523	A very troublesome disease,
4524	In some a willing martyrdom.
4525	Abandoned he his country seat,
4526	Of woods and fields the calm retreat,
4527	Where every day before his eyes
4528	A blood-bespattered shade would rise,
4529	And aimless journeys did commence--
4530	But still remembrance to him clings,
4531	His travels like all other things
4532	Inspired but weariness intense;
4533	Returning, from his ship amid
4534	A ball he fell as Tchatzki did.
4535	Behold, the crowd begins to stir,
4536	A whisper runs along the hall,
4537	A lady draws the hostess near,
4538	Behind her a grave general.
4539	Her manners were deliberate,
4540	Reserved, but not inanimate,
4541	Her eyes no saucy glance address,
4542	There was no angling for success.
4543	Her features no grimaces bleared;
4544	Of affectation innocent,
4545	Calm and without embarrassment,
4546	A faithful model she appeared
4547	Of "comme il faut." Shishkoff, forgive!
4548	I can't translate the adjective.
4549	Ladies in crowds around her close,
4550	Her with a smile old women greet,
4551	The men salute with lower bows
4552	And watch her eye's full glance to meet.
4553	Maidens before her meekly move
4554	Along the hall, and high above
4555	The crowd doth head and shoulders rise
4556	The general who accompanies.
4557	None could her beautiful declare,
4558	Yet viewing her from head to foot,
4559	None could a trace of that impute,
4560	Which in the elevated sphere
4561	Of London life is "vulgar" called
4562	And ruthless fashion hath blackballed.I like this word exceedingly
4563	Although it will not bear translation,
4564	With us 'tis quite a novelty
4565	Not high in general estimation;
4566	'Twould serve ye in an epigram--
4567	But turn we once more to our dame.
4568	Enchanting, but unwittingly,
4569	At table she was sitting by
4570	The brilliant Nina Voronskoi,
4571	The Neva's Cleopatra, and
4572	None the conviction could withstand
4573	That Nina's marble symmetry,
4574	Though dazzling its effulgence white,
4575	Could not eclipse her neighbour's light."And is it," meditates Eugene.
4576	"And is it she? It must be--no--
4577	How! from the waste of steppes unseen,"--
4578	And the eternal lorgnette through
4579	Frequent and rapid doth his glance
4580	Seek the forgotten countenance
4581	Familiar to him long ago.
4582	"Inform me, prince, pray dost thou know
4583	The lady in the crimson cap
4584	Who with the Spanish envoy speaks?"--
4585	The prince's eye Oneguine seeks:
4586	"Ah! long the world hath missed thy shape!
4587	But stop! I will present thee, if
4588	You choose."--"But who is she?"--"My wife.""So thou art wed! I did not know.
4589	Long ago?"--"'Tis the second year."
4590	"To--?"--"Larina."--"Tattiana?"--"So.
4591	And dost thou know her?"--"We live near."
4592	"Then come with me." The prince proceeds,
4593	His wife approaches, with him leads
4594	His relative and friend as well.
4595	The lady's glance upon him fell--
4596	And though her soul might be confused,
4597	And vehemently though amazed
4598	She on the apparition gazed,
4599	No signs of trouble her accused,
4600	A mien unaltered she preserved,
4601	Her bow was easy, unreserved.Ah no! no faintness her attacked
4602	Nor sudden turned she red or white,
4603	Her brow she did not e'en contract
4604	Nor yet her lip compressed did bite.
4605	Though he surveyed her at his ease,
4606	Not the least trace Oneguine sees
4607	Of the Tattiana of times fled.
4608	He conversation would have led--
4609	But could not. Then she questioned him:--
4610	"Had he been long here, and where from?
4611	Straight from their province had he come?"--
4612	Cast upwards then her eyeballs dim
4613	Unto her husband, went away--
4614	Transfixed Oneguine mine doth stay.Is this the same Tattiana, say,
4615	Before whom once in solitude,
4616	In the beginning of this lay,
4617	Deep in the distant province rude,
4618	Impelled by zeal for moral worth,
4619	He salutary rules poured forth?
4620	The maid whose note he still possessed
4621	Wherein the heart its vows expressed,
4622	Where all upon the surface lies,--
4623	That girl--but he must dreaming be--
4624	That girl whom once on a time he
4625	Could in a humble sphere despise,
4626	Can she have been a moment gone
4627	Thus haughty, careless in her tone?He quits the fashionable throng
4628	And meditative homeward goes,
4629	Visions, now sad, now grateful, long
4630	Do agitate his late repose.
4631	He wakes--they with a letter come--
4632	The Princess N. will be at home
4633	On such a day. O Heavens, 'tis she!
4634	Oh! I accept. And instantly
4635	He a polite reply doth scrawl.
4636	What hath he dreamed? What hath occurred?
4637	In the recesses what hath stirred
4638	Of a heart cold and cynical?
4639	Vexation? Vanity? or strove
4640	Again the plague of boyhood--love?The hours once more Oneguine counts,
4641	Impatient waits the close of day,
4642	But ten strikes and his sledge he mounts
4643	And gallops to her house away.
4644	Trembling he seeks the young princess--
4645	Tattiana finds in loneliness.
4646	Together moments one or two
4647	They sat, but conversation's flow
4648	Deserted Eugene. He, distraught,
4649	Sits by her gloomily, desponds,
4650	Scarce to her questions he responds,
4651	Full of exasperating thought.
4652	He fixedly upon her stares--
4653	She calm and unconcerned appears.The husband comes and interferes
4654	With this unpleasant _tete-a-tete_,
4655	With Eugene pranks of former years
4656	And jests doth recapitulate.
4657	They talked and laughed. The guests arrived.
4658	The conversation was revived
4659	By the coarse wit of worldly hate;
4660	But round the hostess scintillate
4661	Light sallies without coxcombry,
4662	Awhile sound conversation seems
4663	To banish far unworthy themes
4664	And platitudes and pedantry,
4665	And never was the ear affright
4666	By liberties or loose or light.And yet the city's flower was there,
4667	Noblesse and models of the mode,
4668	Faces which we meet everywhere
4669	And necessary fools allowed.
4670	Behold the dames who once were fine
4671	With roses, caps and looks malign;
4672	Some marriageable maids behold,
4673	Blank, unapproachable and cold.
4674	Lo, the ambassador who speaks
4675	Economy political,
4676	And with gray hair ambrosial
4677	The old man who has had his freaks,
4678	Renowned for his acumen, wit,
4679	But now ridiculous a bit.Behold Sabouroff, whom the age
4680	For baseness of the spirit scorns,
4681	Saint Priest, who every album's page
4682	With blunted pencil-point adorns.
4683	Another tribune of the ball
4684	Hung like a print against the wall,
4685	Pink as Palm Sunday cherubim,
4686	Motionless, mute, tight-laced and trim.
4687	The traveller, bird of passage he,
4688	Stiff, overstarched and insolent,
4689	Awakens secret merriment
4690	By his embarrassed dignity--
4691	Mute glances interchanged aside
4692	Meet punishment for him provide.
4693	But my Oneguine the whole eve
4694	Within his mind Tattiana bore,
4695	Not the young timid maid, believe,
4696	Enamoured, simple-minded, poor,
4697	But the indifferent princess,
4698	Divinity without access
4699	Of the imperial Neva's shore.
4700	O Men, how very like ye are
4701	To Eve the universal mother,
4702	Possession hath no power to please,
4703	The serpent to unlawful trees
4704	Aye bids ye in some way or other--
4705	Unless forbidden fruit we eat,
4706	Our paradise is no more sweet.Ah! how Tattiana was transformed,
4707	How thoroughly her part she took!
4708	How soon to habits she conformed
4709	Which crushing dignity must brook!
4710	Who would the maiden innocent
4711	In the unmoved, magnificent
4712	Autocrat of the drawing-room seek?
4713	And he had made her heart beat quick!
4714	'Twas he whom, amid nightly shades,
4715	Whilst Morpheus his approach delays,
4716	She mourned and to the moon would raise
4717	The languid eye of love-sick maids,
4718	Dreaming perchance in weal or woe
4719	To end with him her path below.To Love all ages lowly bend,
4720	But the young unpolluted heart
4721	His gusts should fertilize, amend,
4722	As vernal storms the fields athwart.
4723	Youth freshens beneath Passion's showers,
4724	Develops and matures its powers,
4725	And thus in season the rich field
4726	Gay flowers and luscious fruit doth yield.
4727	But at a later, sterile age,
4728	The solstice of our earthly years,
4729	Mournful Love's deadly trace appears
4730	As storms which in chill autumn rage
4731	And leave a marsh the fertile ground
4732	And devastate the woods around.There was no doubt! Eugene, alas!
4733	Tattiana loved as when a lad,
4734	Both day and night he now must pass
4735	In love-lorn meditation sad.
4736	Careless of every social rule,
4737	The crystals of her vestibule
4738	He daily in his drives drew near
4739	And like a shadow haunted her.
4740	Enraptured was he if allowed
4741	To swathe her shoulders in the furs,
4742	If his hot hand encountered hers,
4743	Or he dispersed the motley crowd
4744	Of lackeys in her pathway grouped,
4745	Or to pick up her kerchief stooped.She seemed of him oblivious,
4746	Despite the anguish of his breast,
4747	Received him freely at her house,
4748	At times three words to him addressed
4749	In company, or simply bowed,
4750	Or recognized not in the crowd.
4751	No coquetry was there, I vouch--
4752	Society endures not such!
4753	Oneguine's cheek grew ashy pale,
4754	Either she saw not or ignored;
4755	Oneguine wasted; on my word,
4756	Already he grew phthisical.
4757	All to the doctors Eugene send,
4758	And they the waters recommend.He went not--sooner was prepared
4759	To write his forefathers to warn
4760	Of his approach; but nothing cared
4761	Tattiana--thus the sex is born.--
4762	He obstinately will remain,
4763	Still hopes, endeavours, though in vain.
4764	Sickness more courage doth command
4765	Than health, so with a trembling hand
4766	A love epistle he doth scrawl.
4767	Though correspondence as a rule
4768	He used to hate--and was no fool--
4769	Yet suffering emotional
4770	Had rendered him an invalid;
4771	But word for word his letter read.All is foreseen. My secret drear
4772	Will sound an insult in your ear.
4773	What acrimonious scorn I trace
4774	Depicted on your haughty face!
4775	What do I ask? What cause assigned
4776	That I to you reveal my mind?
4777	To what malicious merriment,
4778	It may be, I yield nutriment!
4779	Meeting you in times past by chance,
4780	Warmth I imagined in your glance,
4781	But, knowing not the actual truth,
4782	Restrained the impulses of youth;
4783	Also my wretched liberty
4784	I would not part with finally;
4785	This separated us as well--
4786	Lenski, unhappy victim, fell,
4787	From everything the heart held dear
4788	I then resolved my heart to tear;
4789	Unknown to all, without a tie,
4790	I thought--retirement, liberty,
4791	Will happiness replace. My God!
4792	How I have erred and felt the rod!
4793	No, ever to behold your face,
4794	To follow you in every place,
4795	Your smiling lips, your beaming eyes,
4796	To watch with lovers' ecstasies,
4797	Long listen, comprehend the whole
4798	Of your perfections in my soul,
4799	Before you agonized to die--
4800	This, this were true felicity!
4801	But such is not for me. I brood
4802	Daily of love in solitude.
4803	My days of life approach their end,
4804	Yet I in idleness expend
4805	The remnant destiny concedes,
4806	And thus each stubbornly proceeds.
4807	I feel, allotted is my span;
4808	But, that life longer may remain,
4809	At morn I must assuredly
4810	Know that thy face that day I see.
4811	I tremble lest my humble prayer
4812	You with stern countenance declare
4813	The artifice of villany--
4814	I hear your harsh, reproachful cry.
4815	If ye but knew how dreadful 'tis
4816	To bear love's parching agonies--
4817	To burn, yet reason keep awake
4818	The fever of the blood to slake--
4819	A passionate desire to bend
4820	And, sobbing at your feet, to blend
4821	Entreaties, woes and prayers, confess
4822	All that the heart would fain express--
4823	Yet with a feigned frigidity
4824	To arm the tongue and e'en the eye,
4825	To be in conversation clear
4826	And happy unto you appear.
4827	So be it! But internal strife
4828	I cannot longer wage concealed.
4829	The die is cast! Thine is my life!
4830	Into thy hands my fate I yield!No answer! He another sent.
4831	Epistle second, note the third,
4832	Remained unnoticed. Once he went
4833	To an assembly--she appeared
4834	Just as he entered. How severe!
4835	She will not see, she will not hear.
4836	Alas! she is as hard, behold,
4837	And frosty as a Twelfth Night cold.
4838	Oh, how her lips compressed restrain
4839	The indignation of her heart!
4840	A sidelong look doth Eugene dart:
4841	Where, where, remorse, compassion, pain?
4842	Where, where, the trace of tears? None, none!
4843	Upon her brow sits wrath alone--And it may be a secret dread
4844	Lest the world or her lord divine
4845	A certain little escapade
4846	Well known unto Oneguine mine.
4847	'Tis hopeless! Homeward doth he flee
4848	Cursing his own stupidity,
4849	And brooding o'er the ills he bore,
4850	Society renounced once more.
4851	Then in the silent cabinet
4852	He in imagination saw
4853	The time when Melancholy's claw
4854	'Mid worldly pleasures chased him yet,
4855	Caught him and by the collar took
4856	And shut him in a lonely nook.He read as vainly as before,
4857	Perusing Gibbon and Rousseau,
4858	Manzoni, Herder and Chamfort,
4859	Madame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot:
4860	He read the unbelieving Bayle,
4861	Also the works of Fontenelle,
4862	Some Russian authors he perused--
4863	Nought in the universe refused:
4864	Nor almanacs nor newspapers,
4865	Which lessons unto us repeat,
4866	Wherein I castigation get;
4867	And where a madrigal occurs
4868	Writ in my honour now and then--
4869	_E sempre bene_, gentlemen!
4870	But what results? His eyes peruse
4871	But thoughts meander far away--
4872	Ideas, desires and woes confuse
4873	His intellect in close array.
4874	His eyes, the printed lines betwixt,
4875	On lines invisible are fixt;
4876	'Twas these he read and these alone
4877	His spirit was intent upon.
4878	They were the wonderful traditions
4879	Of kindly, dim antiquity,
4880	Dreams with no continuity,
4881	Prophecies, threats and apparitions,
4882	The lively trash of stories long
4883	Or letters of a maiden young.And by degrees upon him grew
4884	A lethargy of sense, a trance,
4885	And soon imagination threw
4886	Before him her wild game of chance.
4887	And now upon the snow in thaw
4888	A young man motionless he saw,
4889	As one who bivouacs afield,
4890	And heard a voice cry--_Why! He's killed!_--
4891	And now he views forgotten foes,
4892	Poltroons and men of slanderous tongue,
4893	Bevies of treacherous maidens young;
4894	Of thankless friends the circle rose,
4895	A mansion--by the window, see!
4896	She sits alone--'tis ever _she!_So frequently his mind would stray
4897	He well-nigh lost the use of sense,
4898	Almost became a poet say--
4899	Oh! what had been his eminence!
4900	Indeed, by force of magnetism
4901	A Russian poem's mechanism
4902	My scholar without aptitude
4903	At this time almost understood.
4904	How like a poet was my chum
4905	When, sitting by his fire alone
4906	Whilst cheerily the embers shone,
4907	He "Benedetta" used to hum,
4908	Or "Idol mio," and in the grate
4909	Would lose his slippers or gazette.Time flies! a genial air abroad,
4910	Winter resigned her empire white,
4911	Oneguine ne'er as poet showed
4912	Nor died nor lost his senses quite.
4913	Spring cheered him up, and he resigned
4914	His chambers close wherein confined
4915	He marmot-like did hibernate,
4916	His double sashes and his grate,
4917	And sallied forth one brilliant morn--
4918	Along the Neva's bank he sleighs,
4919	On the blue blocks of ice the rays
4920	Of the sun glisten; muddy, worn,
4921	The snow upon the streets doth melt--
4922	Whither along them doth he pelt?Oneguine whither gallops? Ye
4923	Have guessed already. Yes, quite so!
4924	Unto his own Tattiana he,
4925	Incorrigible rogue, doth go.
4926	Her house he enters, ghastly white,
4927	The vestibule finds empty quite--
4928	He enters the saloon. 'Tis blank!
4929	A door he opens. But why shrank
4930	He back as from a sudden blow?--
4931	Alone the princess sitteth there,
4932	Pallid and with dishevelled hair,
4933	Gazing upon a note below.
4934	Her tears flow plentifully and
4935	Her cheek reclines upon her hand.Oh! who her speechless agonies
4936	Could not in that brief moment guess!
4937	Who now could fail to recognize
4938	Tattiana in the young princess!
4939	Tortured by pangs of wild regret,
4940	Eugene fell prostrate at her feet--
4941	She starts, nor doth a word express,
4942	But gazes on Oneguine's face
4943	Without amaze or wrath displayed:
4944	His sunken eye and aspect faint,
4945	Imploring looks and mute complaint
4946	She comprehends. The simple maid
4947	By fond illusions once possest
4948	Is once again made manifest.
4949	His kneeling posture he retains--
4950	Calmly her eyes encounter his--
4951	Insensible her hand remains
4952	Beneath his lips' devouring kiss.
4953	What visions then her fancy thronged--
4954	A breathless silence then, prolonged--
4955	But finally she softly said:
4956	"Enough, arise! for much we need
4957	Without disguise ourselves explain.
4958	Oneguine, hast forgotten yet
4959	The hour when--Fate so willed--we met
4960	In the lone garden and the lane?
4961	How meekly then I heard you preach--
4962	To-day it is my turn to teach.
4963	"Oneguine, I was younger then,
4964	And better, if I judge aright;
4965	I loved you--what did I obtain?
4966	Affection how did you requite?
4967	But with austerity!--for you
4968	No novelty--is it not true?--
4969	Was the meek love a maiden feels.
4970	But now--my very blood congeals,
4971	Calling to mind your icy look
4972	And sermon--but in that dread hour
4973	I blame not your behaviour--
4974	An honourable course ye took,
4975	Displayed a noble rectitude--
4976	My soul is filled with gratitude!
4977	"Then, in the country, is't not true?
4978	And far removed from rumour vain;
4979	I did not please you. Why pursue
4980	Me now, inflict upon me pain?--
4981	Wherefore am I your quarry held?--
4982	Is it that I am now compelled
4983	To move in fashionable life,
4984	That I am rich, a prince's wife?--
4985	Because my lord, in battles maimed,
4986	Is petted by the Emperor?--
4987	That my dishonour would ensure
4988	A notoriety proclaimed,
4989	And in society might shed
4990	A bastard fame prohibited?
4991	"I weep. And if within your breast
4992	My image hath not disappeared,
4993	Know that your sarcasm ill-suppressed,
4994	Your conversation cold and hard,
4995	If the choice in my power were,
4996	To lawless love I should prefer--
4997	And to these letters and these tears.
4998	For visions of my childish years
4999	Then ye were barely generous,
5000	Age immature averse to cheat--
5001	But now--what brings you to my feet?--
5002	How mean, how pusillanimous!
5003	A prudent man like you and brave
5004	To shallow sentiment a slave!
5005	"Oneguine, all this sumptuousness,
5006	The gilding of life's vanities,
5007	In the world's vortex my success,
5008	My splendid house and gaieties--
5009	What are they? Gladly would I yield
5010	This life in masquerade concealed,
5011	This glitter, riot, emptiness,
5012	For my wild garden and bookcase,--
5013	Yes! for our unpretending home,
5014	Oneguine--the beloved place
5015	Where the first time I saw your face,--
5016	Or for the solitary tomb
5017	Wherein my poor old nurse doth lie
5018	Beneath a cross and shrubbery.
5019	"'Twas possible then, happiness--
5020	Nay, near--but destiny decreed--
5021	My lot is fixed--with thoughtlessness
5022	It may be that I did proceed--
5023	With bitter tears my mother prayed,
5024	And for Tattiana, mournful maid,
5025	Indifferent was her future fate.
5026	I married--now, I supplicate--
5027	For ever your Tattiana leave.
5028	Your heart possesses, I know well,
5029	Honour and pride inflexible.
5030	I love you--to what end deceive?--
5031	But I am now another's bride--
5032	For ever faithful will abide."
5033	She rose--departed. But Eugene
5034	Stood as if struck by lightning fire.
5035	What a storm of emotions keen
5036	Raged round him and of balked desire!
5037	And hark! the clank of spurs is heard
5038	And Tania's husband soon appeared.--
5039	But now our hero we must leave
5040	Just at a moment which I grieve
5041	Must be pronounced unfortunate--
5042	For long--for ever. To be sure
5043	Together we have wandered o'er
5044	The world enough. Congratulate
5045	Each other as the shore we climb!
5046	Hurrah! it long ago was time!
5047	Reader, whoever thou mayst be,
5048	Foeman or friend, I do aspire
5049	To part in amity with thee!
5050	Adieu! whate'er thou didst desire
5051	From careless stanzas such as these,
5052	Of passion reminiscences,
5053	Pictures of the amusing scene,
5054	Repose from labour, satire keen,
5055	Or faults of grammar on its page--
5056	God grant that all who herein glance,
5057	In serious mood or dalliance
5058	Or in a squabble to engage,
5059	May find a crumb to satisfy.
5060	Now we must separate. Good-bye!
5061	And farewell thou, my gloomy friend,
5062	Thou also, my ideal true,
5063	And thou, persistent to the end,
5064	My little book. With thee I knew
5065	All that a poet could desire,
5066	Oblivion of life's tempest dire,
5067	Of friends the grateful intercourse--
5068	Oh, many a year hath run its course
5069	Since I beheld Eugene and young
5070	Tattiana in a misty dream,
5071	And my romance's open theme
5072	Glittered in a perspective long,
5073	And I discerned through Fancy's prism
5074	Distinctly not its mechanism.
5075	But ye to whom, when friendship heard,
5076	The first-fruits of my tale I read,
5077	As Saadi anciently averred--
5078	Some are afar and some are dead.
5079	Without them Eugene is complete;
5080	And thou, from whom Tattiana sweet;
5081	Was drawn, ideal of my lay--
5082	Ah! what hath fate not torn away!
5083	Happy who quit life's banquet seat
5084	Before the dregs they shall divine
5085	Of the cup brimming o'er with wine--
5086	Who the romance do not complete,
5087	But who abandon it--as I
5088	Have my Oneguine--suddenly.










2771	Nor Byron, Walter Scott, nor Seneca,
1284	Fair source of every fine idea,
 585	Upon the highway of the sea
 567	Ye billows of blue Hadria's sea,
2952	Time to denote by dinner, tea,
 886	Perchance where Dunia pours out tea
2774	Its name, my friends, was Martin Zadeka,
2866	At last the author!" cries Mamma.
2610	But sudden fear assailed Tattiana,
2606	Tattiana
1303	"Say, of the two which was Tattiana?"
1305	And silent as the maid Svetlana
2611	And I, remembering Svetlana,
2438	Next Saturday. The Larina
1285	Verses and tears et cetera.
2998	Bouyanoff whisked off Poustiakova.
2995	To Tania Lenski; Kharlikova,
5045	Each other as the shore we climb!
1195	Opened the portals of the tomb
3772	My poor Vladimir! In the tomb,
3737	And lo! where lies a marble tomb
1222	He writes upon his parents' tomb,
5016	Or for the solitary tomb
3779	Is the world to him sealed and dumb?
3465	The inmate is for ever dumb,
 314	And oft its Dictionary thumb.
 924	He oft upon his lips would curb,
 925	Thinking: 'tis foolish to disturb
2839	He found them in an almanac,
1414	And Virtue acts as a narcotic,
1416	And triumphs in career erotic.
1281	What! really going? 'Tis too bad!
1210	Above the ashes of the dead.
1868	Ah! than a spectre from the dead
5078	Some are afar and some are dead.
4123	To seek him out with bended head.
2166	Shaking with serious air the head,
3118	Now of a family the head,
 457	Whene'er he had an aching head;
2616	And soon Lel hovered o'er her head.
 432	His shop, a night-cap on his head,
3247	All silently hung down his head.
1761	And gently hovered o'er my head?
2983	For patience, reader, I must plead!
 638	But on the third of grove and mead
2559	Or a swift hare from mead to mead
4194	But ah! discerns nor wood nor mead--
 433	And pauses oft to serve out bread.
1783	With shame I shudder and with dread--
4843	Upon her brow sits wrath alone--And it may be a secret dread
1456	Unto a ruthless tyrant dread.
 656	I slumber much, a little read,
1553	For on their brows I trembling read
5076	The first-fruits of my tale I read,
2008	Do not excuse yourself. I read
2189	Some nice instructive novel read,
3163	And lessons to his children read.
3911	But presently she tried to read;
1782	'Tis finished. Horrible to read!
 768	No other book had time to read.
2984	A little farther please to read
 456	Nor slander viciously could spread
3738	And two old pines their branches spread--
3882	The pile of books, with carpet spread
3741	Thereon the passing traveller read:
4359	I Apuleius gladly read
4126	For the impatient chief instead.
 519	And cool sagacious mind he had:
3916	A new world was made manifest!Although we know that Eugene had
4733	Tattiana loved as when a lad,
3539	Inhabited the country, clad
3540	In dressing-gown, a cuckold glad:
1282	But Lenski, I should be so glad
4909	Would lose his slippers or gazette.Time flies! a genial air abroad,
4099	Could taste the pleasures of the road.
4350	Grant that I err not on the road."
2676	He dragged her by a forest road
3724	An idle anchorite and sad,
2077	His arm he offers. Mute and sad,
4735	In love-lorn meditation sad.
 520	I was incensed and he was sad.
3918	Still certain authors, I may add,
2299	At seven in summer rose from bed,
2764	With book in hand reclined in bed,
2615	Undressed herself and went to bed
4191	Aroused Tattiana from her bed.
2155	With hopeless passion: from her bed
1178	'Tis time for supper, now for bed,
3883	Beneath the window-sill his bed,
3544	And finally, upon his bed
4188	She could not sleep in her new bed.
2614	So she her silken sash unlaced,
3860	Upon the tumbled sofa placed,
2869	The friends are called and quickly placed.Right opposite Tattiana placed,
2686	Bear gone--she at the threshold placed;
 318	Eugene in hackney carriage placed.
 774	The ancient _barshtchina_ replaced
3501	Most carefully Zaretski placed
3091	Except one by the window placed
2617	Beneath her downy pillow placed,
3442	He drops his pistol silently.He on his bosom gently placed
3715	In coach or post-cart duly placed
4155	The two old ladies then embraced
3090	Lay all the girls by sleep embraced,
3936	In what he merely acquiesced.
1320	To all good neighbours' sport conduced.
1318	At Larina's abode produced
 789	Most by this circumstance offended
 790	All overtures of friendship ended.
1147	The workpeople she superintended,
1150	The bath on Saturdays attended,
1412	Vice had due punishment awarded,
4062	When to enlarge we shall succeed,
5022	It may be that I did proceed--
2072	Not all will like myself proceed--
3902	Thither in future to proceed
1469	And cares not farther to proceed;
3075	'Tis done. To supper they proceed.
4064	Will not five centuries exceed
 782	He was a dangerous fool indeed.
1509	Mortally sick I am indeed.
 767	His uncle, busy man indeed,
3914	Remarkable. She then indeed
2911	Hissed forth. With serious air indeed,
 657	Of fleeting glory take no heed.
1507	But I perceive thou dost not heed--"
 639	He took no more the slightest heed;
4956	"Enough, arise! for much we need
3078	Up to the attic, and all need
1467	She seeks the garden in her need--
4007	Whither and wherefore do I speed
2560	Had run across her path at speed,
3565	Whene'er across the plain at speed
5020	Nay, near--but destiny decreed--
2909	From the moist cork the bottle freed
 781	And all with one accord agreed,
3566	Alone she gallops on her steed,
 215	On the dull stage find all things changed,
1327	But the date subsequently changed
4485	By visions who was ne'er deranged
1326	The wedding-day had been arranged,
4486	Nor from the mob polite estranged,
 218	A careless looker-on estranged
4954	A breathless silence then, prolonged--
4953	What visions then her fancy thronged--
1454	What bitter tears with thee I shed!
1948	And long perukes hath vanished.
1503	And bitter tears of fright I shed.
2341	Drive out the cattle from their shed,
4989	And in society might shed
 709	I mourn, but tears I cannot shed--
 599	Just at that time his father died,
1494	My mother-in-law who lately died
1415	Vice in romance is glorified
1180	Customs by ages sanctified,
4511	A visionary mortified,
1413	Virtue was with a bride rewarded.But now our minds are mystified
 615	But in his heart dissatisfied,
2859	And ringing wine-glasses are plied.
1492	Were you in love when you were young?"--"Alack! Tattiana," she replied,
1847	Lenski unto the dame replied,
1196	And a new diadem supplied.
2548	The new moon's crescent slim she spied,
2896	Tattiana's trouble might have spied,
2898	By a rich pie were occupied--
3576	Longtime her mind is occupied.
4153	The princess from the sofa cried
3105	"I shall expire," Tattiana cried,
 761	And not a speck of dirt descried.
3190	The matter by his conscience tried,
 669	To sketch myself that I have tried
1768	Delusions of a mind untried,
1683	I should alarm our friendship tried:
4271	Successfully to please her tried,
4601	Her bow was easy, unreserved.Ah no! no faintness her attacked
2380	The balls impelled, the blunt cue chalked;
3960	And a long time about her talked.
2379	He round the billiard-table stalked,
3959	Whither two neighbouring dames have walked
1849	Shamefaced, Tattiana downward looked
5010	This life in masquerade concealed,
4828	I cannot longer wage concealed.
2623	By melancholy fogs concealed.
3488	Tell me, of sentiments concealed
2316	And such unconsciously he led,
2298	A hermit's life Oneguine led,
4608	He conversation would have led--
1869	More swift the room Tattiana fled,
2317	Nor marked how summer's prime had fled
2156	Sweet slumber winged its way and fled.
 710	Soon, of the tempest which hath fled
1552	But, I acknowledge, from them fled;
4607	Of the Tattiana of times fled.
4187	Repose her silken curtains fled,
2738	The troop of apparitions fled,
1758	Nay! even as this instant fled,
1810	The pains of night have wholly fled,
4561	Of London life is "vulgar" called
4982	Is it that I am now compelled
3962	Cried the old dame with anguish filled:
3495	And with remorseful anguish filled,
4026	As if with eider-down is filled.
3497	Zaretski shouted: "Why, he's killed!"--
4890	And heard a voice cry--_Why! He's killed!_--
4025	The channel of the river stilled
1370	Our tender dreamer had enrolled
3116	A gambling troop when he controlled,
3541	A life of fact, not fiction, led--
 147	By Faublas in his youth was schooled,
3150	And to the field of honour led;
2214	Which might for many ages last.Surely ye all have overhauled
1154	With blood instead of ink she scrawled,
2216	Which all her darling friends have scrawled
1156	And in her conversation drawled.
 784	But since to the backdoor they led
 540	Transparent o'er the Neva beamed
3456	The peace which on his forehead beamed,
2934	But kindness from his eye had beamed
 542	And when the watery mirror gleamed
4266	Her the ideal which he dreamed,
3074	As if some troubled dream she dreamed.
4499	The purest of the dreams we dreamed,
1575	She never of deception dreamed
2260	His elegies, which plenteous streamed,
3458	The blood gushed from the wound and steamed
1573	Pursues phantasmagoria vain.Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed?--
 917	A few of different temper deemed,
  61	Oneguine was--so many deemed,
4265	But one buffoon unhappy deemed
2261	Both natural and truthful seemed.
3073	And endless the cotillon seemed
4498	That our desires which noblest seemed,
4988	A notoriety proclaimed,
4985	Because my lord, in battles maimed,
3508	When hope's delightful flower but bloomed
2464	He thought so, and existence charmed.
2466	And he who, jealousy disarmed,
4708	How soon to habits she conformed
4706	Our paradise is no more sweet.Ah! how Tattiana was transformed,
3796	To say farewell, and fussed and fumed
3793	Only her countenance assumed
3510	The manly toga scarce assumed,
2632	Tattiana in despair unfeigned
2210	Where many another hand had signed
2229	And vows will probably be signed:
3984	Her money counted, and designed
2904	Tall, slender, like thy form designed,
3939	Made revelations undesigned,
 465	Though, God be praised! he ne'er designed
2894	Caricatures he now designed
3529	That, for the century designed,
1596	Or even, silent and resigned,
4913	Spring cheered him up, and he resigned
3926	To arid selfishness resigned,
1565	When harsh demeanour hath consigned
3690	Which Autumn late to earth consigned,
 500	Because a member I became.Once more to idleness consigned,
1595	Have e'er a precious tress consigned,
3522	His lyre, to silence now consigned,
4775	What do I ask? What cause assigned
2022	A happy destiny ordained:
3132	A valuable hostage gained,
3133	A modern Regulus unchained,
2634	Tattiana o'er the stream complained;
1588	Whose hearts responsive have remained
2789	Inseparable they remained.
1586	So irremissible appear?O ye whom tender love hath pained
2447	And saying this Vladimir drained
2788	She consolation thence obtained--
  58	A something somehow have obtained,
4489	At fifty who relief obtained
2020	My sum of happiness contained;
 864	He sang of life's fresh colours stained
4492	Hath tranquilly in turn attained,
  60	With us is easily attained.
 806	The fruits of learning and combined
1407	And handsome countenance combined,
2211	A tender couplet he combined,
1406	With intellect, a taste refined,
4914	His chambers close wherein confined
 674	Love to idealize inclined;
3912	At first for books was disinclined,
2613	I'm not for witchcraft now inclined.
2225	And on the last one, underlined:
2562	Anticipating woe she pined,
3982	The venerable dame opined
2563	Certain misfortune near opined.
2661	Now a long branch itself entwined
 988	Constant affection intertwined
1717	If the fond hope I could have fanned
2302	There, aping Gulnare's bard, he spanned
2246	Though Baratynski verses penned,
4034	Alarm the winter journey gave.The date was fixed though oft postponed,
2925	The maiden's weary eye which yearned,
2153	A spirit which for sorrow yearned.
2154	Tattiana more than ever burned
1209	His neighbour's lowly tomb and mourned
2923	Tattiana thanks to all returned,
1207	To his Penates now returned,
4128	He on the conflagration frowned.
1290	Our heroes at full gallop sped,
1500	The matchmaker a fortnight sped,
1854	Into the cups already sped
4744	Of lackeys in her pathway grouped,
4760	Of his approach; but nothing cared
3843	A countenance perplexed and scared.
3100	An explanation: she was scared,
4543	Her features no grimaces bleared;
2694	Another with cock's head appeared,
  89	But Adam Smith to read appeared,
2987	My word of honour given have I.The tea, as I remarked, appeared,
4546	A faithful model she appeared
4833	To an assembly--she appeared
 777	But this a heinous crime appeared
4250	But in the drawing-room all appeared
5038	And Tania's husband soon appeared.--
3452	For evermore had disappeared.
3975	O yes! my hopes soon disappeared."
4992	My image hath not disappeared,
3099	With Olga; nor of this appeared
1169	In dressing-gown at meals appeared.
3405	Meals, secrets, occupations shared?
3403	Asunder was and hate prepared?
4758	And they the waters recommend.He went not--sooner was prepared
3974	I mused: perhaps the matter's squared--
3149	Quarrels among young friends he bred
 786	Upon the Don's broad pastures bred
3162	Both ducks and geese in plenty bred
  88	Homer, Theocritus, he jeered,
 780	And many another slily sneered;
1167	In her affairs ne'er interfered,
3669	Seemed in a haze of green embowered.
3672	The valleys dried and gaily flowered;
1947	Their glory with their heels of red
2991	His soul by crash of music fired,
 523	Extinct the flame which once had fired;
1340	By indolence and languor fired
2264	Singing God knows what maid admired,
 399	To kiss the feet which I admired!
2263	In amorous flights when so inspired,
2992	His tea with rum no more desired,
1709	'Tis in your power now, if desired,
 398	How like the billow I desired
1341	The fated nutriment desired;
 522	And both of dull existence tired,
1707	Strummed by a timid schoolgirl o'er.I write to you! Is more required?
 246	I long by ballets have been bored,
3126	An ace at fifteen paces bored.
2268	Since Fame and Freedom he adored,
1977	Though beauty he no more adored,
3124	His ruffian bravery adored,
4754	Either she saw not or ignored;
2940	Neighbour by neighbour sat and snored,
1146	And harmony was soon restored.
2939	Contented and with victuals stored,
 974	Deeming himself a veteran scarred
3007	I long enough deceived have erred.
1374	Of the romances she preferred,
2539	And what she from the cards inferred.
1215	The Medal Otchakoff conferred!
2786	Tattiana every day conferred
4327	Where the first time she met with _him_.Thus widely meditation erred,
1376	Tattiana through the forest erred,
2259	Of Olga he in song averred;
5077	As Saadi anciently averred--
4637	In the recesses what hath stirred
4329	Whilst from her countenance ne'er stirred
4378	And by a partial temper stirred
1218	And by a genuine sorrow stirred,
 535	Oneguine's speeches I abhorred
2692	Sit many monstrous shapes abhorred.
 632	He who economy abhorred,
4636	What hath he dreamed? What hath occurred?
2082	Of censure for the same incurred;
2997	The poet from Tamboff secured,
1328	Till proper rings could be procured.
 536	At first, but soon became inured
2579	On melted wax in water poured;
2270	Odes Lenski also had outpoured,
1325	In fact, some people were assured
1979	Rebuffed--as quickly reassured,
2996	A marriageable maid matured,
3415	Trembles at artificial shame.The shining pistols are uncased,
1912	Till the fire in her cheek decreased;
2871	More timid than a doe long chased,
 412	The contact of the foot I raised
4267	And leaning 'gainst the portal closed
2089	You, he a noble mind disclosed,
3086	On chairs in the saloon reposed,
4268	To her an elegy composed.
3085	And Flianoff, somewhat indisposed,
2090	Though some men, evilly disposed,
3283	Was famous for thick-headedness.Lenski that eve in thought immersed,
1102	In love adventures she was versed,
3285	But he who by the Muse was nursed
3533	The blessings of humanity.Or, it may be, the bard had passed
1347	Alas! for now before her passed
 814	When Friendship smiled or Love caressed.
3296	"What ails thee?"--"Nothing."--He is fled.At home arriving he addressed
4748	At times three words to him addressed
1756	And when I prayer to Heaven addressed
3298	Replaced them in their box, undressed
 304	The style in which my hero dressed;
3795	When all around the entrance pressed,
1481	"What ails thee, dear?"--"I feel depressed.
1799	But sits in bed with air depressed,
2511	Are not with elegance impressed.
1801	The image of her seal impressed.
4184	And kindness Tania was impressed,
3935	Oneguine was the most impressed,
1011	And thoughts of Olga first impressed
1404	Ever by adverse fate oppressed,
4186	The strange apartment her oppressed:
4993	Know that your sarcasm ill-suppressed,
1753	Is it not truth? in tones suppressed
3417	Bullets are down the barrels pressed,
4114	How much is in that word expressed!
1633	So she in French herself expressed.
3444	Not agony, but death expressed.
4621	Wherein the heart its vows expressed,
3257	Delighted, almost sane in mind.But once more pensive and distressed
4182	Then weeping she sank back distressed
3794	A deadly pallor, air distressed;
3259	Nor enough strength of mind possessed
1913	But tremor still her frame possessed,
4620	The maid whose note he still possessed
3273	If the poor maiden could have guessed
3192	Within that secret court discussed,
1116	That rascal Lovelace she abused;
2220	By friendship how they were abused,
4599	No signs of trouble her accused,
3971	The hussar Pykhtin was accused.
3969	Bouyanoff courted. She refused.
4863	Nought in the universe refused:
4596	And though her soul might be confused,
2221	Hewn, hacked, and otherwise ill-used.
4862	Some Russian authors he perused--
3869	A book at early morn perused.
1114	Not that she had his works perused,
3870	The room my former master used.
3191	Was with himself dissatisfied.In fact, the subject analysed,
 447	Was he in health and void of care?--Even so! His passions soon abated,
1908	The frolics of maidens.They sang, whilst negligently seated,
3206	He ought to have conciliated
1967	By daily life deteriorated,
3204	But man of sense and probity.He might his motives have narrated,
3097	Her inmost soul had penetrated,
 449	Nor long his mind was agitated
1968	Awhile this beauty captivated,
 938	Were to analysis subjected.
3956	Hath she a fitting phrase selected?
 937	And life and fate in turn selected
3958	They long at home have her expected--
3095	His visit she had not awaited,
1910	Tattiana with impatience waited
4990	A bastard fame prohibited?
1208	Vladimir Lenski visited
3972	How the young imp on Tania doted!
3973	To captivate her how devoted!
1855	By Olga's hand distributed
2534	And every year distributed
 881	All mothers their sweet girls believed
3940	Of what he thought and what believed,
4497	And she at last hath us deceived;
 879	Lenski as a good match received,--
4495	In vain was youth by us received,
3937	Upon those margins she perceived
 677	Retained the image, though short-lived,
 800	The neighbourhood fresh sport derived.
4147	At an old aunt's they had arrived
3370	Harnessed the rapid sledge arrived:
 798	A new proprietor arrived,
4657	They talked and laughed. The guests arrived.
3373	The fatal tubes Lepage contrived
 678	Which afterwards the muse revived.
4658	The conversation was revived
4148	Who had for four long years survived
3183	Turned and replied as it behoved,
 996	Which glowed with virginal desire.When but a boy he Olga loved
3253	Perceived that he was still beloved,
4421	And ditties of the steppe she loved.
 998	He witnessed tenderly and moved
3254	Already by repentance moved
3182	Oneguine, by first impulse moved,
4424	And as a country damsel roved,
3931	And these the attentive maid observed
1181	Strictly the Carnival observed,
3388	And ancient usages observed
  34	For first "madame" his wants observed,
3929	His energy and impotence.And numerous pages had preserved
1179	And soon the friendly troop hath fled.They in a peaceful life preserved
4600	A mien unaltered she preserved,
  33	But Eugene was by fate preserved,
 849	But proudly in his song preserved
 848	The gifted songster never swerved,
 960	And when her violence reviewed--
3681	The breath of Spring again renewed,
3119	Simple and kindly and unwed,
  54	Without the least constraint he bowed.
4438	Who to the youthful hostess bowed,
4749	In company, or simply bowed,
2798	Et cetera_; but nothing showed
3361	He gazed upon the clock which showed
 867	A scant attendance Lenski showed
2677	Till amid trees a hovel showed,
4911	Oneguine ne'er as poet showed
2149	I know there's none more amiable.But from the interview what flowed?
2151	The insensate fire of love still glowed
2084	And privileges nice allowed,
4740	Enraptured was he if allowed
  51	He wrote and spoke, so all allowed,
1638	In correspondence been allowed.
4385	Passion's wild sway I then allowed,
4669	And necessary fools allowed.
4349	Having a trusty staff bestowed,
2535	Journeys and warriors to wed.
4442	Please her by their decorum fixed,
4444	Titles and ages intermixed.
1001	He with his little maiden played,
1085	At prisoner's base she never played.
1302	The deuce with my inside has played."
 206	The drama of my youth was played.
 735	Meadows and cornfields are displayed,
4943	Without amaze or wrath displayed:
1310	In Olga's face no life's displayed.
2948	All sons of mental weariness.Eight rubbers were already played,
5023	With bitter tears my mother prayed,
1082	And when for Olga nurse arrayed
4496	That we her constantly betrayed
 679	Thus carelessly I once portrayed
2950	Change of position had essayed,
1211	There long time sad at heart he stayed:
1333	Yet was her inmost soul o'erjoyed
3687	Upon a soul inert and cloyed?--
1086	Their noisy laugh her soul annoyed,
1331	Of course Tattiana was annoyed
3688	And is all light within destroyed?
2604	"What is your name?" The boor looked dazed,
4598	She on the apparition gazed,
 411	Again imagination blazed,
2605	And "Agathon" replied, amazed.
4597	And vehemently though amazed
 107	Which Ovid once immortalized,
 690	Whom hath thy strain immortalized?
 688	With tenderness hath recognized
 108	For which the poet agonized
3193	In much his conduct stigmatized;
 620	He found him on the table laid,
2802	And many a day thereafter laid
3420	The powder in the pan is laid,
3977	Should go, the market for a maid,
2079	And, hanging down her head, the maid
1006	Beneath her parents' eyes the maid
3905	At early morn returns the maid
2344	Singing inside her hut the maid
4946	She comprehends. The simple maid
3727	My pretty self-deceiving maid--
2740	Remained with him the youthful maid.
2255	In Olga's album, youthful maid,
5024	And for Tattiana, mournful maid,
 577	Alone with my Venetian maid,
 680	Mine own ideal, the mountain maid,
2670	For shame lift up the modest maid.
2310	Of a young dark-eyed country maid,
2799	Her Martin Zadeka in aid,
4352	To classicism I've homage paid,
3526	Fortune the poet had repaid.
2257	Nor frigid adulation paid.
1301	That bilberry wine, I'm sore afraid,
2667	No time to pick it up! afraid,
2646	Bruin is marching at her back!She, to turn back her eyes afraid,
2006	Oneguine then approached and said:
3295	Gazing into his face, she said:
1212	"Poor Yorick," mournfully he said,
2078	Tattiana doth accept his aid;
1292	What they in conversation said?--
3903	That certain volumes she might read.Adieu she to the matron said
1518	And the old nurse a brief prayer said
 943	Though scarcely following what was said,
3978	With many a vacancy, 'tis said."--
2167	In whispers low the neighbours said:
4955	But finally she softly said:
1315	Vladimir something curtly said
4151	And spectacles, his knitting staid
3316	So be it! Just the laws which bid
2191	Better than Chateaubriand did
4534	A ball he fell as Tchatzki did.
3315	In mist profound all yet is hid.
4770	Had rendered him an invalid;
4533	Returning, from his ship amid
4981	Wherefore am I your quarry held?--
2621	She dreamt she journeyed o'er a field
4889	As one who bivouacs afield,
3487	Scornfully challenged you afield--
4725	And thus in season the rich field
4726	Gay flowers and luscious fruit doth yield.
5009	What are they? Gladly would I yield
3057	And can it be? But late a child
3961	"What can be done? She is no child!"
1584	An ardent heart and yet so mild?--
3058	And now a fickle flirt and wild,
1581	With an imagination wild,
1367	Werther, rebellious martyr bold,
2335	The wolf upon the highways bold
3115	Zaretski, once a bully bold,
4673	Blank, unapproachable and cold.
2506	He laughs, although it aches from cold,
  28	But cannot stand the northern cold.
2507	His mother from the door doth scold.
 757	His housekeeper was wont to scold,
4837	And frosty as a Twelfth Night cold.
2333	November at the gate did stand.The morn arises foggy, cold,
 178	And Limburg cheese alive and old
 755	He took the room wherein the old
  92	How empires store of wealth unfold,
1117	But that Princess Pauline of old,
  27	I also wandered there of old,
1493	"We never loved in days of old,
2530	These evenings as in days of old
 734	Afar, where clothed in green and gold
  95	The medium is required of gold.
 179	Is seen next pine-apples of gold.
4836	Alas! she is as hard, behold,
 733	Before it ran a stream. Behold!
4672	Some marriageable maids behold,
 763	In one he doth accounts behold,
 148	And the suspicious veteran old,
2536	Tattiana in traditions old
 766	An almanac but eight years old.
2538	In dreams and what the moon foretold
1495	Had killed me had the like been told."
1118	Her Moscow cousin, often told
2533	And the young ladies fortunes told,
3657	A journey to Moscow! To see the world!
4354	The Great World
3056	Heard he the truth? And thus she could--
3054	She promised Eugene, or she would
2188	Or kiss the border of her dress.To Olga frequently he would
1172	Of friends unceremonious would
4571	The Neva's Cleopatra, and
 835	Exist--that their immortal band
2636	No one appeared to lend a hand.
4765	Than health, so with a trembling hand
3494	Heedless of your despairing cry?Eugene, his pistol yet in hand
2917	Intoned it, manuscript in hand.
1642	With the "Well-Wisher" in her hand!
 410	Her foot was in my other hand.
2305	Some wretched journal in his hand;
2332	A weary season was at hand--
 591	Of Africa, ancestral land,
3701	With thoughts of a far distant land,
 367	To agitate me in my dreams.When, where, and in what desert land,
 834	Friends of the sons of every land,
2608	And in the bathroom did command
1828	In times gone by thy bare command--"
4764	Sickness more courage doth command
3702	Of a strange night when the moon and--
2920	The poet, modest though so grand,
 369	Those feet? Alas! on what far strand
 590	To dream upon the sunny strand
4086	With blessings on the ditches and
3496	Gazing on Lenski's corse did stand--
1719	To see you by our fireside stand,
4572	None the conviction could withstand
 408	Immersed in secret thought I stand
1829	"Oh! nurse, nurse, you don't understand!
3427	At each extreme one takes his stand,
4934	Her tears flow plentifully and
2018	To thy decree my will I bend.
3230	To cock the pistol; barrel bend
4819	A passionate desire to bend
4719	To end with him her path below.To Love all ages lowly bend,
2247	The thunderbolt on you descend!
4518	Wearied of leisure in the end,
1165	And had with waddling in the end
 383	Charms more enduring in the end.
5063	And thou, persistent to the end,
1640	Learn Russian, but the Lord defend!
2406	But thou, Bordeaux, art like the friend
 381	Are admirable, my dear friend,
4515	In duel having killed his friend
2446	Will you?"--"Agreed."--"I thank you, friend,"
5061	And farewell thou, my gloomy friend,
4820	And, sobbing at your feet, to blend
3981	If not, the money I will lend."
2017	An ear to my confession lend;
4010	Their natural attractions lend
4721	His gusts should fertilize, amend,
4804	Yet I in idleness expend
4803	My days of life approach their end,
4757	All to the doctors Eugene send,
3980	"Enough to see one winter's end;
2409	Assistance ever will extend,
4008	And what will Destiny concede?"Farther Tattiana's walks extend--
3712	Into the starry night extend.
3713	Quick to the country let us wend
1447	But finally in wedlock bind.
3301	His mournful heart no peace could find,
3653	Where thine equal shall we find?
 887	The young proprietor we find;
2222	Upon the opening page ye find:
 362	Scarcely in Russia can ye find
1564	But what astonished do I find
1446	Fresh cause of quarrel then I'll find,
2227	Beyond this may attempt to write_.Infallibly you there will find
3256	But trembles, words he cannot find,
2659	And all in snow is buried deep.The wood she enters--bear behind,--
 592	Of dreary Russia left behind,
3382	"Your second you have left behind!"
3520	Ye dreams of heavenly poesy?Perchance to benefit mankind,
 807	A fiery and eccentric mind,
3383	A duellist of classic mind,
3692	Of which the rustling woods remind?
3530	Had perished a creative mind,
3925	His immorality of mind
 502	From mere vacuity of mind
3913	But soon their choice seemed to her mind
 888	To Dunia then they whisper: Mind!
2612	Become alarmed. So never mind!
 987	One image occupied his mind,
3300	But one thought only filled his mind,
 464	It gradually possessed his mind;
3938	Oneguine's pencillings. His mind
 365	A pair; though desolate my mind,
2905	Zizi, thou mirror of my mind,
 676	And the recesses of my mind
4776	That I to you reveal my mind?
 589	So uncongenial to my mind,
2776	Who dreams expound and prophecies.Brought by a pedlar vagabond
1184	Of whirligigs were very fond,
 748	And stoves of various shapes abound.
 624	Funeral amateurs abound!
1888	However cherries might abound,
1323	What jokes and guesses now abound,
1911	Until her heart less high should bound--
2678	By barren snow heaped up and bound,
2331	Of clamorous geese flew southward bound.
4048	These to the coach of state are bound,
1183	Twice in the year to fast were bound,
3787	The lancer, to his calling bound,
2625	A stream, by winter's ice unbound,
4475	That mind which yearns for space is bound?
1157	She wore her corset tightly bound,
1324	A beau is for Tattiana found!
3272	And if Tattiana mine had found--
4423	Lo! in my garden was she found
2778	This monument of thought profound
4127	From hence engrossed in thought profound
1887	(This by command; for it was found,
4036	Examined, mended, newly found
4050	Baggage is heaped up in a mound,
1321	Endless conjectures all propound
1322	And secretly their views expound.
4422	But suddenly all changed around!
 747	Imperial portraits hang around
 622	And from the country all around
4474	Selfish nonentities around?
 431	The German baker looks around
3662	The snows from off the hills around
2679	A tangled wilderness around.
2924	But, when Oneguine's turn came round,
4731	And leave a marsh the fertile ground
3664	And flooded all the level ground.
2343	Of horn in circle call them round.
2624	Amid the snowdrifts which surround
2685	And her upon the threshold laid.Recovering, Tania gazes round;
3785	Whilst struggling for the heritage.Soon Olga's accents shrill resound
2687	Inside clink glasses, cries resound
2922	Then handed her the song with grace.Congratulations, toasts resound,
 340	And by the fiddle's rushing sound
1909	Attentive to the echoing sound,
2342	Nor at the hour of noon with sound
1158	The Russian N with nasal sound
 428	Morning awakes with joyous sound;
2328	Were stripped with melancholy sound,
3270	"I with my friend intend to fight!"If he had only known the wound
3641	Amid coquettes who pray to God
4791	Will happiness replace. My God!
4100	Seven days and nights the travellers plod.
 932	Debate commanded ample food--
 934	The fruits of science, evil, good,
 880	Such is the country custom good;
 878	The gossip of their ladies fair.Handsome and rich, the neighbourhood
1173	Assemble from the neighbourhood:
3731	Which in a hilly neighbourhood
3630	And spur my spirit's torpid mood!
 553	Absorbed in melancholy mood
4801	But such is not for me. I brood
3891	Tattiana as enchanted stood;
3423	Guillot behind a pollard stood;
 555	Oneguine meditative stood,
3833	Sees where a noble mansion stood,
2190	Whose author nature understood
4903	At this time almost understood.
3834	A village and beneath, a wood,
3893	Dark was the valley and the wood
3733	The river through the linden wood.
3642	And abject slaves who kiss the rod;
4792	How I have erred and felt the rod!
 803	A worshipper of Kant, a bard,
1261	The Country DamselCanto The Third"Whither away? Deuce take the bard!"--
2913	Triquet arose, and for the bard
3451	He was no more! The youthful bard
2695	Here an old witch with hirsute beard,
 975	In love's campaigns Oneguine heard
5075	But ye to whom, when friendship heard,
4377	Her utterances ever heard,
2258	What never was remarked or heard
2989	When in the grand saloon was heard
5037	And hark! the clank of spurs is heard
4248	Nor aught confides unto the rest.Tattiana would have gladly heard
3197	And ought he not to disregard
4994	Your conversation cold and hard,
3198	The poet's madness? for 'tis hard
1263	"I won't detain you; but 'tis hard
 804	A young and handsome galliard.
2691	What doth she see? Around the board
2914	The company deep silence guard.
1125	Her Grandison was in the Guard,
 162	He hies unto the "Boulevard,"
3844	She enters a deserted yard--
4195	Beneath her lay a strange courtyard,
2537	Believed, the people's wisdom weird,
2785	Marmontel also, tome the third;
4831	Epistle second, note the third,
1123	Whose qualities appeared to afford
2581	She deemed its outline might afford.
 629	Lo! my Oneguine rural lord!
1122	Sighs on another than her lord
1145	To dominate her worthy lord,
1819	Command him not to say a word--
3010	Reform me both in deed and word,
2081	Together they returned, nor word
 961	Each gust of temper, silly word,
4755	Oneguine wasted; on my word,
 962	Seems so unnatural and absurd:
1822	Of late I have been quite absurd,--
 333	No more the music thunders loud,
4276	With lengthened howl and accent loud,
1637	And never hath our language proud
4398	Of my light paramour was proud.
 332	He enters: in the hall a crowd,
4387	Pursuits I followed of the crowd,
4750	Or recognized not in the crowd.
4435	Amazed at the confusing crowd,
4278	Before a cold indifferent crowd,
4743	Or he dispersed the motley crowd
4397	And I, amid the friendly crowd,
4623	That girl--but he must dreaming be--
   6	But what a nuisance it will be,
2012	Feelings which long had ceased to be
2026	I would desire my bride to be--
 986	Is still condemned in love to be;
 115	Sombre or glad in turn to be,
3011	And this fifth canto ought to be
 742	As lordly mansions ought to be,
3261	He mused: "I will her saviour be!
 155	As many entertainments be!
1813	"Do not--you might--suspicious be;
4164	Is it a dream, and can it be?
1749	Long ago. Dream it cannot be!
5047	Reader, whoever thou mayst be,
2551	Or a swift meteor, may be,
3151	Or reconciled them, it may be,
3525	With worldly honours, it may be,
3398	Lenski replied, and soon they be
 903	Inseparable soon they be.
2842	Whilst he "belle Nina" had the face
 711	Time will the ravages efface--
  12	And physic bring with mournful face,
4793	No, ever to behold your face,
1730	I never should have seen your face
5015	Where the first time I saw your face,--
4942	But gazes on Oneguine's face
3728	No more the village knows his face,
1996	Pallid and melancholy face,
1304	"She who with melancholy face
4774	Depicted on your haughty face!
5014	Oneguine--the beloved place
2680	Bright blazed the window of the place,
1938	Her in the pitfalls which we place.
3906	To the abandoned dwelling-place.
  35	And then "monsieur" supplied her place;
1306	Hard by the window took her place."--
1728	Why did you visit our poor place?
2921	Drank to her health in the first place,
4794	To follow you in every place,
1388	And after them at headlong pace
  16	Through clouds of dust at postal pace,
2683	"Warm yourself here a little space!"
3904	At the front gates, but in brief space
2647	Accelerates her hasty pace,
1297	Hallo, Andriushka, onward race!
  36	The boy was wild but full of grace.
1300	An ancient lady full of grace.--
1936	The easier 'tis to gain her grace,
1995	He called to mind Tattiana's grace,
1705	A print without the picture's grace,
 473	Callous to all he seemed to be.Ye miracles of courtly grace,
 956	And who the rent-roll of his race
  18	Inheritor of all his race.
4773	What acrimonious scorn I trace
3729	For there he left a mournful trace.
  44	And my Eugene the path must trace--
 183	Of the commencement of the piece.
 484	Stately, devoid of prejudice,
1410	Was ready for self-sacrifice,
2350	Behold! than polished floor more nice
2388	A blessed bottle, placed in ice,
2351	The shining river clothed in ice;
1126	A noted fop who gambled hard.Like his, her dress was always nice,
1039	But wherefore not?--'Tis pleasant, nice,
4027	The hoar-frost glitters: all rejoice
1040	Euphonious, though I know a spice
4028	In mother Winter's strange caprice.
4346	And the extent of his caprice;
1430	And shall adopt some new caprice.
2386	"Bring dinner now without delay!"Upon the table in a trice
1409	The excited hero in a trice
1128	But contrary to her advice
 481	Then they're so innocent of vice,
2628	Two poles together glued by ice,
1185	Of Christmas carols, song and dance;
3098	And his strange conduct at the dance
 213	Again in her ethereal dance?
4886	Before him her wild game of chance.
3481	Can scarce in sweetness be a match.Well, if your pistol ball by chance
4779	Meeting you in times past by chance,
5057	In serious mood or dalliance
1747	Thine eye subdued me with strange glance,
3096	His momentary loving glance
5056	God grant that all who herein glance,
4425	A pensive sorrow in her glance
3483	Who by a haughty word or glance
4780	Warmth I imagined in your glance,
4261	In thee, thou world of empty bliss.In groups, official striplings glance
4579	Frequent and rapid doth his glance
 238	Free scope he yields unto his glance,
 214	Or will my melancholy glance
 243	Upon the stage his weary glance.
 545	The days of love and of romance!
4426	And in her hand a French romance.
 716	Canto the First of this romance.
 239	Reviews both dress and countenance,
1186	When people with long countenance
4580	Seek the forgotten countenance
 244	He yawns, averts his countenance,
1748	I heard thy voice's resonance
4884	A lethargy of sense, a trance,
 546	Then would we muse as in a trance,
3428	A loaded pistol in his hand."Advance!"--
 714	The hero's name too in advance,
4263	And views amongst themselves advance
2002	Such open-hearted innocence.
3987	Of her provincial innocence
4239	Then to reward such confidence
3986	Tattiana learns the intelligence--
4240	Her amorous experience
1691	He wanders in his indolence;
1551	And natural benevolence,
4529	And aimless journeys did commence--
4899	Oh! what had been his eminence!
2040	Habit would bring indifference.
1688	I yield with a low reverence;
3165	To friendship making no pretence,
2423	I cannot tell on what pretence--
1929	But this adventure's consequence
1932	I, after so much eloquence,
4466	Not to behave as he did once--
4463	Or a good fellow for the nonce,
3216	Our idol, Honour's motive force,
4154	And the newcomers welcome bade.
2476	And yet oblivion forbade.
3419	Lo! poured in a thin gray cascade,
3527	It may be that his martyred shade
2308	The murmuring brook, the woodland shade,
 649	My lyre sings sweeter in the shade
1005	As in a thicket's humble shade,
 576	Hid in the gondola's dark shade,
 738	Whilst nearer, sunk in deeper shade,
1000	Beneath the sheltering oak tree's shade
 205	There, there, beneath the side-scene's shade
4357	In the Lyceum's noiseless shade
3245	Was the first question Olga made,
2588	He whom we sing to shall be made
 647	Or better,--like a faithful wife.I was for calm existence made,
2684	Straight for the entrance then he made
2800	Though the foul vision promise made
4353	Though late, have a beginning made.
4494	As to a worthy man and good!But sad is the reflection made,
2766	But no reply unto her made.
 271	For our amusement ever made
1316	Nor further comment that night made.
2475	Whose heart experience icy made
4845	A certain little escapade
2587	They shovel silver with a spade,
 300	The goddess would a masquerade
 270	Choosing a profitable trade,
1309	Were I like you a bard by trade--
2648	But cannot anyhow evade
5032	For ever faithful will abide."
3066	His fate shall presently decide.
1766	Doubt and uncertainty decide:
5031	But I am now another's bride--
4405	Like Leonora did she ride
4053	A lean and shaggy nag doth ride,
3574	She leisurely away doth ride,
1846	"He promised here this day to ride,"
4512	Or monster of Satanic pride,
 670	Like Byron, bard of scorn and pride,
3636	Amid the soulless sons of pride
4052	A bearded postillion astride
3228	Unto the windmill he must ride
 902	On horseback every day they ride--
4691	Mute glances interchanged aside
3401	In consultation stand aside--
3227	But now all doubt was set aside,
2549	Suddenly to the left hand side,
 600	And soon Oneguine's door beside
4406	With me Caucasian rocks beside!
3065	A pair of bullets--nought beside--
 614	And hastened to his uncle's side,
2280	Yes, happy--though she at his side
4270	Tattiana by a poor aunt's side,
 901	But grown familiar side by side
2180	Found them in darkness side by side,
1681	If thou wert sitting by my side,
2857	Jaws are at work. On every side
1182	Ate Russian pancakes at Shrovetide,
2179	Always together, eventide
4692	Meet punishment for him provide.
3104	Beneath her roaring opened wide:
1194	And death before the husband wide
4152	And the saloon threw open wide;
 762	Oneguine oped the cupboards wide.
4667	Noblesse and models of the mode,
2801	Of a most mournful episode,
 861	To foreign lands he would allude,
4493	And unto whom we all allude
4617	Deep in the distant province rude,
 958	Beneath the flag of Quietude,
3682	Secure in rural quietude--
 137	Then, then--well, in some solitude
4615	Before whom once in solitude,
 862	Where long time he in solitude
4802	Daily of love in solitude.
3598	In worldly din or solitude
 865	Before he eighteen years attained.Since Eugene in that solitude
3631	Fly frequent to my solitude,
4976	My soul is filled with gratitude!
3426	Measured with great exactitude.
4975	Displayed a noble rectitude--
4902	My scholar without aptitude
5049	To part in amity with thee!
1771	From henceforth I confide to thee!
2059	Hath fate apportioned unto thee
2025	Then, I say truly, none but thee
3838	"Shall I proceed, or homeward flee?
4847	'Tis hopeless! Homeward doth he flee
2660	In snow she sinks up to the knee;
1226	By Providence's dark decree!
3514	Tender and elevated, free?
 586	When shall I wing my passage free
3012	From such digressions wholly free.
 472	Impressed him in the least degree,--
 159	Perchance he will to all the three.
2192	Yet sometimes pages two or three
 153	His valet brings him letters three.
2780	Tome of "Malvina," and but three
  86	Knew not an iamb from a choree,
1453	My tongue is somewhat rusty now.Tattiana! sweet Tattiana, see!
3441	The poet's hour hath sounded--See!
3840	The house and garden I would see."
 889	And a guitar produced we see,
3399	Behind the mill. Meantime ye see
4315	Gallop, mazurka, waltzing--see!
1561	Virgins miraculous I see,
4810	Know that thy face that day I see.
  50	The giddy world at last shall see.
 158	Whither shall he go first? He'll see,
3168	He usually was glad to see
3963	"Olinka is her junior, see.
1798	But nought for this Tattiana cares.The break of day she doth not see,
1831	The letter is the thing, you see,--
4895	A mansion--by the window, see!
4461	Childe Harold, quaker, devotee,
2315	Such was Oneguine's sainted life,
4983	To move in fashionable life,
1964	He in the early years of life
 150	Who floats contentedly through life,
3623	Commence a new career in life
1002	Whilst the fond parents, friends thro' life,
 646	And like his shadow dogged his life,
3537	In many things had changed his life--
4520	He knew not how to spend his life.
2132	Should be respected throughout life
4829	The die is cast! Thine is my life!
2050	And leads a solitary life?
4827	So be it! But internal strife
2318	In aimless ease and far from strife,
1966	Of error and the passions' strife.
3538	The Muse abandoned, ta'en a wife,
2133	By every proper-minded wife,
1003	Dreamed in the future man and wife.
2048	Wherein the miserable wife
1199	By children and by faithful wife
4984	That I am rich, a prince's wife?--
 151	Proud of his dinners and his wife!
4519	Without profession, business, wife,
4679	But now ridiculous a bit.Behold Sabouroff, whom the age
4727	But at a later, sterile age,
2945	In boston and the game of age,
2944	And testy gamesters do engage
4516	And reached, with nought his mind to engage,
5058	Or in a squabble to engage,
3597	Sterner solicitudes engage,
3762	Another could her heart engage,
3927	A visionary personage
3594	As once, to fill the rapid page
4681	Saint Priest, who every album's page
5055	Or faults of grammar on its page--
1432	With humble prose I'll fill my page
4730	As storms which in chill autumn rage
1431	Thus having braved Apollo's rage
3784	Remains on earth the unseemly rage,
3924	As the reflection of his age,
4517	The twenty-sixth year of his age,
3763	Another could her woe assuage
4331	Both aunts looked knowing as a judge,
4332	Each gave Tattiana's arm a nudge
 634	To vary for a few brief days.For two whole days it seemed a change
4419	Our godlike tongue she could exchange
 636	The cool dark oaken grove to range,
3476	But sweeter still it is to arrange
4420	For savage speech, uncouth and strange,
3479	Placed at the customary range;
2974	Is sweeter than thy Helen foul.No one the contrary will urge,
2976	Again a century should scourge
4924	Unto his own Tattiana he,
4687	The traveller, bird of passage he,
4624	That girl whom once on a time he
  84	For empty sound the rascal swore he
   5	A paragon of virtue he!
3474	Sweeter it is, my friends, if he
3025	All are amazed; but Lenski he
 296	Three mortal hours per diem he
2915	Tania well nigh expired when he
 819	And by a sweet delusion he
1421	Or Melmoth, gloomy wanderer he,
2918	Voices and hands applaud, and she
1631	And in her native language she
2781	And a half rubles down gave she;
1800	Nor on the letter yet hath she
4167	"Oh! I remember, where is he?"--
1346	She oped her eyes and cried: 'tis he!
1752	And cried within myself: 'tis he!
2553	And disappear in space; then she
4633	On such a day. O Heavens, 'tis she!
4381	And an encouragement did breathe
3352	To Lucifer the cock must breathe
4380	They first of all my brow did wreathe
 530	No fond illusions live to soothe,
  10	A dying man with art to soothe,
 984	Men love no more, as only the
3871	On Sundays by yon window he,
  49	Dressed like a London dandy he
4799	Before you agonized to die--
1777	And silently I here must die--
3853	The family of children hie.
2329	Upon the earth a mist did lie
3493	When deaf and silent he doth lie
5017	Wherein my poor old nurse doth lie
3555	There the tired ploughman loves to lie,
2986	There'll be a fight. I do not lie.
2837	_Reveillez-vouz, belle endormie_.
4199	Contemplate her sad reverie.
3513	Of youthful impulse, reverie,
2098	Dark, unavailing reverie,
1994	Aroused in him sweet reverie.
4789	Unknown to all, without a tie,
1874	The bridge and alley to the lake,
4818	The fever of the blood to slake--
4386	Her promptings unto law did make,
1606	I the same admonition make.
 829	He deemed his friends but longed to make
 895	Acquaintance instantly to make.
1605	E'en as the presence of a snake,
1873	Through park and meadow, wood and brake,
 830	Great sacrifices for his sake!
 653	For law I _far niente_ take
4388	My sportive Muse I used to take
 654	And every morning I awake
4817	To burn, yet reason keep awake
3484	Or any trifle else ye like
  62	Pedantic although scholar like,
1314	Of the horizon she is like!"--
1848	"The post hath kept him, it is like."
4065	By computation) it is like
3348	Oneguine waits on us, 'tis like."
3482	The comrade of your youth should strike,
3347	"'Tis time to get up! Seven doth strike.
4066	Our roads transformed the eye will strike;
  68	Then suddenly discharge a joke
3951	A bogy conjured up in joke,
2413	And barely visible the smoke
 120	How artless was the note which spoke
2928	He bowed to her nor silence broke,
2746	And Lenski followed--a light broke--
  69	The ladies' laughter to provoke.
2755	Tattiana terrified awoke.
4273	By Tania, smoothing his peruke,
3892	But it grew late; cold blew the gale;
3674	Already sings the nightingale.
4031	Nor the frost particles inhale
1021	But now in her effulgence pale
2870	She, than the morning moon more pale,
4404	How oft beneath the moonbeams pale
4753	Oneguine's cheek grew ashy pale,
2550	She trembled and grew deadly pale.
4403	Entranced me by some mystic tale.
 618	Thus we began our little tale--
1251	Then it may be, O flattering tale,
3335	Approach, approach; I am thine own."Thus in a style _obscure_ and _stale_,
3000	The ball in all its splendour shone.I tried when I began this tale,,
3554	Its waters to the neighbouring vale.
3037	Fashion is there immutable,
5029	Honour and pride inflexible.
2110	And loves you as--a relative!Ahem! Ahem! My reader noble,
2112	Permit me; is it worth the trouble
3412	Ere crimson stains their hands defile,
2000	Regained authority awhile,
1886	Singing in chorus all the while.
1176	Thus the time passes and meanwhile
3338	To see aught--never mind meanwhile)
3017	The moment for revenge, meanwhile,
2235	Because I should be sure, meanwhile,
2458	Though we, of Hymen foes, meanwhile,
2108	Quite inadvertently meanwhile;
3018	Espying, Eugene with a smile
1657	As rosy lips without a smile,
1175	They crack a feeble joke and smile--
2238	That afterwards with evil smile
3993	To mark with a contemptuous smile.
2105	Which your true friend with a sweet smile
3411	Cannot they amicably smile
 741	'Twas built, the venerable pile,
2891	Swearing how Lenski he would rile,
1983	Scarce mindful of their love and guile.
1889	They disappeared by stealth and guile,
2001	But he desired not to beguile
1434	Shall my declining years beguile;
1658	The Russian language I deem vile
4861	Also the works of Fontenelle,
4797	Long listen, comprehend the whole
1274	About the rain and flax and cattle."--
4254	In their sterility of prattle,
1273	Preserves and an eternal prattle
4255	Questions and news and tittle-tattle,
 720	I owe the censorship a little.
 719	But will not modify a tittle--
4737	The crystals of her vestibule
4767	Though correspondence as a rule
4736	Careless of every social rule,
4860	He read the unbelieving Bayle,
3336	He wrote ('tis the romantic style,
3990	Her toilette's antiquated style,
2892	Avenge himself in proper style.
2461	A novel in Lafontaine's style,
3002	To sketch ye in Albano's style.
 743	In solid, unpretentious style,
1433	And a romance in ancient style
2759	The door flew open--Olga came,
 448	Hateful the hollow world became,
1927	Tattiana faltered, and became
1050	Nor by her beauty she became
 802	From Gottingen inspired he came,
1987	And straight returning whence he came,
4454	"And is it long since back he came?
1883	Will he pursue?--But no one came.
2843	By "belle Tattiana" to replace.Lo! from the nearest barrack came,
1079	But when the winter season came
1840	Tattiana waits. No answer came!
3432	Athwart the snow four paces came--
2745	Her shoulder--Olga swiftly came--
4567	But turn we once more to our dame.
2248	Whene'er a brilliant courtly dame
2845	And comfort of each country dame,
3516	The thirst of knowledge and of fame,
3123	Time was the flattering voice of fame,
1396	In hopes of everlasting fame
 845	And at the altar of their fame
1610	Will be ascribed by treacherous Fame
1078	Strange unto her each childish game,
1986	He takes his seat, concludes his game,
3517	Horror of sinfulness and shame,
4473	By recklessness amuse or shame
1715	Believe me, of my present shame
 499	That vicious set whom I don't blame--
 846	He kindled his poetic flame.
1928	Scarlet as burnt by inward flame.
 450	By love's inevitable flame.
2748	And gazed around with eyes of flame;
4472	Is it that ardent souls of flame
1607	Who knows? with love's consuming flame
2760	More blooming than the Boreal flame
3414	But fashionable hatred's flame
 970	Lost in the hamlet far away.And in addition youth is flame
1036	We are the first who such a name
1716	You never would have heard the name,
1048	And so Tattiana was her name,
 801	Vladimir Lenski was his name,
1397	A finished madrigal would frame
1882	She waits, on fire her trembling frame--
4218	Her friend Monsieur Finemouche the same,
4453	Pray is it he? It is the same.
1838	Another passed; 'twas just the same.
4219	Her wolf-dog and her husband tame;
4373	The old Derjavine noticed me,
 516	His character attracted me.
4400	And fled afar--she followed me.
 772	Of many an economic scheme;
5071	And my romance's open theme
1248	And then the stanzas of my theme
2277	Who reads his visionary theme
  65	Of touching lightly every theme.
 978	He with an innocence extreme
2356	Descends the bank with care extreme,
1272	Who welcome guests with zeal extreme,
   1	"My uncle's goodness is extreme,
 569	And, inspiration firing me,
 164	Until the sleepless Breguet chime
 463	Transported to our Russian clime.
 596	And visit many a foreign clime,
2526	On sunny days the glistening rime,
1976	Destroyed the blossom of his prime.
2365	His footing on the treacherous rime
2527	Sledging, the snows, which at the time
2431	She is an angel! We sometime
 598	For a protracted space of time.
1975	And thus he spent eight years of time,

 165	Announcing to him dinner-time.
5046	Hurrah! it long ago was time!
 461	It now to investigate is time,
2359	Which falls in starry flakes below.How in the country pass this time?
1733	By time
2366	And may fall headlong any time.
1713	You will not all abandon me.
2250	Despair and anger seize on me,
2160	Across her youth a shade had come,
1352	Tiresome unto her hath become
3464	All dark and silent hath become;
3778	Callous to all on earth become--
2326	And shorter had the days become.
4611	Straight from their province had he come?"--
1336	I am in love, my hour hath come!
 313	Though to the Academy I come
 581	When will my hour of freedom come!
3864	In winter time would often come.
3265	Nor shall the caterpillar come
3749	At eventide would hither come,
4631	He wakes--they with a letter come--
3221	Triumphant with the answer come.
1985	To take a hand at whist oft come:
1351	His name: the tenderness of home
5013	Yes! for our unpretending home,
1335	As in her heart the thought sank home,
3896	Long, long the hour had past when home
3786	No longer through her former home;
3748	Time was, two maidens from their home
4632	The Princess N. will be at home
2201	With his own pawn alas! his rook!Homeward returning, he at home
1988	Tranquilly goes to sleep at home,
3219	The bard his answer waits at home,
3083	With better half as cumbersome;
4364	That first the Muse appeared to me.
2203	An album, fly-leaf of the tome,
4163	"Ah! come, Tattiana, come to me!
3675	Mournful is thine approach to me,
1665	But I--what is all this to me?
1830	What is thy cleverness to me?
2095	But Lord! from friends deliver me!
1811	Thy cheek is as a poppy red!""Ah! nurse, a favour do for me!"--
3475	Howl like a dolt: 'tis meant for me!
1480	Open the window--sit by me."
4960	In the lone garden and the lane?
1060	Oft staring through the window pane
3014	Undeviating and insane
 187	Of the domains of the side-scene.
2752	Struck Lenski dead--across the scene
1437	But shall depict the touching scene
5053	Pictures of the amusing scene,
4449	Doth seem to him the festal scene.
 727	The PoetCanto The SecondThe village wherein yawned Eugene
2750	Tattiana motionless abides.The strife grew furious and Eugene
1963	Such were the musings of Eugene.
 273	Adorned the apartment of Eugene,
3200	Sincerely loving him, Eugene
3389	."My second!" cried in turn Eugene,
 922	All this was novel to Eugene.
3349	He was in error; for Eugene
4575	Could not eclipse her neighbour's light."And is it," meditates Eugene.
4452	Who may he be? Is it Eugene?
5033	She rose--departed. But Eugene
3189	And so departed. But Eugene,
2373	A true Childe Harold my Eugene
 663	Between myself and my Eugene,
4211	Our dear old aunt, Princess Helene,
1024	As a poetic life serene,
 455	And irrigate them with champagne;
2736	Are turned upon her. All combine
2713	He smiles, in laughter all combine;
2770	Yet neither Virgil nor Racine
3863	The master always used to sit."Departed Lenski here to dine
4670	Behold the dames who once were fine
1371	A single being: 'twas in fine
1602	The sneers of critics superfine;
3166	Admired his judgment, which was fine,
1375	Clarissa, Julia, Delphine,--
3685	And make a dark existence shine
 254	The lamps illuminating shine;
3145	He could in disputation shine
2425	Tattiana, saucy Olga thine?"--
1740	'Tis Heaven's will and I am thine.
4157	"Aline!"
3156	Diminishes as years decline.
3684	Do all things which to mirth incline.

1600	Condemn not weak Tattiana mine;
3164	He was no fool, and Eugene mine,
 292	A new Kaverine Eugene mine,
1372	No other than Oneguine mine.
4846	Well known unto Oneguine mine.
3157	But, as I said, Zaretski mine

1687	Where art thou? Come! pretensions mine
3865	Please follow this way, lady mine,
1686	Of my impassioned heroine.
1373	Dreaming herself the heroine
4285	Never upon my heroine

4844	Lest the world or her lord divine
5084	Before the dregs they shall divine
2512	Another bard with art divine
2912	Long tortured by his lay divine,
 388	I love them, O my dear Elvine,
 871	About the crop of hay, the wine,
2427	Give me just half a glass of wine--
5085	Of the cup brimming o'er with wine--
2910	With loud explosion, the bright wine
1741	The sum of my existence gone
2999	All to the grand saloon are gone--
3080	To pass the night at home hath gone.
4626	Can she have been a moment gone
2592	Frosty the night; the heavens shone;
4906	Whilst cheerily the embers shone,
1385	That hero, though his merit shone,
1536	"Nurse, leave me. I would be alone.
 616	Having for money's sake alone
3079	Tranquil repose. Eugene alone
2895	Of all the guests within his mind.Certainly not Eugene alone
4905	When, sitting by his fire alone
4876	'Twas these he read and these alone
  13	To sigh and meditate alone:
1727	Can hearty welcome give alone.
2565	In horror for itself alone,
 110	On the steppes of Moldavia lone,
3828	The river's bank. Tattiana lone
3212	Undoubtedly, disdain alone
3334	Maid whom my heart desires alone,
1539	Good-night." Behold! she is alone!
 828	Waiting his coming--his alone!
 192	Moina recalls for this alone
3783	Dies suddenly: of heirs alone
2739	And in the frosty night alone
4480	That mediocrity alone
1729	Forgotten in the village lone,
4842	Where, where, the trace of tears? None, none!
2978	Though around honoured Priam's throne
2737	In one great shout: she's mine! she's mine!"Mine!" cried Eugene with savage tone.
2881	Said something in an undertone
1383	She murmurs in an undertone
1246	That like a friendly voice its tone
2897	But that the eyes of every one
 561	Lo! on the sleeping river borne,
1837	But send your grandson before long."No answer all that day was borne.
1950	A constant harping on one tune,
1477	The nightingale trills forth her tune;
3582	Of fashionable dames the foe,
1863	The mystic monogram, O. E.
2787	With Martin Zadeka. In woe
1520	The aged woman in her woe:
4718	Dreaming perchance in weal or woe
2410	Or quietly partake our woe.
1426	E'en hopeless egoism's dark shape.
4586	"Ah! long the world hath missed thy shape!
1425	Could in romantic mantle drape
 512	His book-shelf instantly doth drape
1763	To whisper comfort, love and hope?
4508	'Tis dreadful--ye agree, I hope--
3946	Had bid her sigh for without hope--
1725	In country solitude you mope,
1724	'Tis said you are a misanthrope,
4510	For a fictitious misanthrope,
3947	A dangerous, gloomy misanthrope,
2363	On horseback gallop o'er the steppe!
 979	His inner consciousness laid bare,
2655	Through aspens, limes and birches bare,
3600	I am acquainted with fresh care,
1525	Tattiana's beauty, pale with care,
2242	Albums magnificent which scare
3450	Gazed on him, called him. Useless care!
2185	Lenski at intervals would dare,
2402	To cope with Ay no more I dare,
3263	The vile seducer shall not dare
 305	Though I confess I hardly dare
4700	O Men, how very like ye are
 446	Or vainly 'mid luxurious fare
 198	With Ozeroff was wont to share
 668	And impiously should declare,
4812	You with stern countenance declare
1634	I cannot help it I declare,
4557	None could her beautiful declare,
4450	Doth his brow wretchedness declare
 817	The riot of the world and glare
4290	The crash of music, candles' glare
1937	And the more surely we ensnare
2045	What pleasures Hymen would prepare
4049	Breakfast the busy cooks prepare,
2240	If cleverly or not I prate.But, O ye tomes without compare,
 673	Than one's own fascinating self.Here I remark all poets are
1643	I ask, all ye who poets are,
4224	Moscow's young Graces at her stare,
1613	Tattiana's love was quite sincere,
4180	Now I am fit for nothing here.
4560	Which in the elevated sphere
4304	The moon in the blue atmosphere.
1206	Enjoyeth peaceful slumber here_.
1555	"Abandon hope for ever here!"
1878	"He's here! Eugene is here!
 980	And Eugene soon discovered there
4451	Or suffering pride? Why is he there?
2822	With all their progeny were there,
4931	Alone the princess sitteth there,
1676	I promised!--Did I so?--Well, there!
 197	The young Simeonova too there
  25	It may be ye were born, or there
4666	By liberties or loose or light.And yet the city's flower was there,
4335	"The left? Why, what on earth is there?"--
3236	And lo! he is already there!
  24	Was born beside the Neva, where
 170	He bends his course to Talon's, where
4668	Faces which we meet everywhere
2985	And be not in advance severe.
 722	I yield the fruit of work severe.
4834	Just as he entered. How severe!
4995	If the choice in my power were,
1080	And dark and drear the evenings were,
 671	As if impossible it were
 818	Still sovereigns of his spirit were,
3238	Olga with trepidation dire.
2554	Would haste in agitation dire
5066	Oblivion of life's tempest dire,
3308	And spouted it with lyric fire--
 874	Nor sparkled with poetic fire,
1401	Authors replete with sacred fire
 405	Or bosom full of languid fire,--
 417	The proud ones are not worth the fire
4091	For our Automedons are fire
5034	Stood as if struck by lightning fire.
2886	Our misanthrope was full of ire,
 386	Their privileged allurements fire
 894	With our Oneguine doth aspire
5048	Foeman or friend, I do aspire
1244	Yet still apparently aspire
1969	And that no longer could inspire.
3237	He deemed his coming would inspire
 875	Nor wit, nor did the same inspire
 571	Whose tones Apollo's sons inspire,
5036	Raged round him and of balked desire!
2555	To mutter her concealed desire
 387	A hidden train of wild desire.
1403	All that perfection could desire;
5065	All that a poet could desire,
 501	He felt the laudable desire
1243	This world. I do not praise desire,
 402	So ardently did I desire
 892	But Lenski, having no desire
5050	Adieu! whate'er thou didst desire
2887	At a great feast against desire,
1970	Slowly exhausted by desire,
 995	His constant soul could ever tire,
4092	And our swift troikas never tire;
 503	The wit of others to acquire.
2829	Now buffoon, glutton, and a bore.
4694	Within his mind Tattiana bore,
4849	And brooding o'er the ills he bore,
1803	Opened with care, and entering bore
1754	With thee I conversed when I bore
1484	Within my memory I bore
2522	Tattiana, Russian to the core,
1706	Or, as it were, the Freischutz' score
2524	The Russian winter did adore
 684	Whom doth thy plaintive Muse adore?
2729	And the young girl appeared before
3239	He was deceived. Just as before
4856	And shut him in a lonely nook.He read as vainly as before,
1457	Thou'lt suffer, dearest, but before,
 966	They stir the heart as heretofore.
4407	How oft to the Crimean shore
2635	To help her to the other shore
4699	Of the imperial Neva's shore.
 681	The captives of the Salguir's shore.
 393	Or by the ocean's rocky shore.
 588	'Tis time to quit this weary shore
1773	And thy protection I implore.
4850	Society renounced once more.
3921	With it may be a couple more;
1047	With affectation,--nothing more.
4410	Where Nereids murmur evermore,
2633	Rooted unto the spot remained.As if against obstruction sore
 406	A gust of passion never tore
2663	Away her golden earrings tore;
1046	Endowing us from out her store
2937	As bees who leave their dainty store
2664	Now the sweet little shoes she wore,
2825	Bouyanoff too, my cousin, wore
2828	Rogue and extortioner of yore,
4158	"Who would have thought it? As of yore!
1483	"But which, my dear?--In days of yore
2960	As thou, great Homer, didst of yore,
2629	A fragile bridge and insecure,
1949	For who imposture can endure,
4484	Hath gradually learnt to endure;
2519	But competition I abjure
2689	But deeming all this nonsense pure,
4375	Then my companions young with pleasure
  78	In history he took no pleasure,
1144	Found out the secret how at pleasure
  81	Yet still of anecdotes a treasure
5042	For long--for ever. To be sure
4160	"Sit down. How funny, to be sure!
1143	And then she soon 'twixt work and leisure
4376	In the unfettered hours of leisure

4482	Happy who timely grew mature,

5012	For my wild garden and bookcase,--
 831	That a friend's arm in every case
 251	Still the loud stamping doth not cease,
3038	Who tyrannizes us with ease,
4088	The journey in a sledge doth please,
3850	The damsel under escort place."Can I inspect the mansion, please?"
2577	With childlike lisp will lie to please.
4702	Possession hath no power to please,
4119	Napoleon tarried till it please
4347	O epic Muse, my powers increase
 181	To cool the cutlets' seething grease,
4523	A very troublesome disease,
   2	If seriously he hath disease;
4605	Though he surveyed her at his ease,
4090	Glides with a more luxurious ease;
4029	But Tania's heart is not at ease,
1390	In motley and amusing chase.
3849	The curs away to kennel chase,
2649	Her shaggy myrmidon in chase.
  46	Monsieur clean out of doors they chase.
3608	Not even a poetic phrase,
2027	I say without poetic phrase,
4112	Moscow! How much is in the phrase

1721	Address to you one single phrase
1685	To russify the foreign phrase
2473	Who every gesture, every phrase
 948	Eugene would speak regarding these.
2576	It matters not. Hope e'en to these
5051	From careless stanzas such as these,
1159	She would pronounce _a la Francaise_;
4716	She mourned and to the moon would raise
3879	And in her languid bosom raise
 418	Of passion they so often raise.
4412	To God eternal hymns of praise.
 907	As cyphers others to appraise,
 415	Away! and cease to ring their praise
4384	How sweet a dream your memories raise!
4411	And where the billows hoarsely raise
 223	The curtain now they slowly raise.
 453	Because he could not gourmandise
1174	They growl a bit--they scandalise--
 335	Crushing and a confusing noise;
3846	But at her shriek ran forth with noise
 435	Tired by the ball's incessant noise,
2353	Engrave the ice with strident noise.
4625	Could in a humble sphere despise,
3303	Miraculously fair arise,
1690	Where melancholy rocks arise
2730	Those hellish phantoms. Peals arise
 558	Of the night sentinels arise
2262	Thus thou, Yazykoff, dost arise
1925	When Eugene like a ghost did rise
4528	A blood-bespattered shade would rise,
 430	In column blue the smoke doth rise;
 683	Oft upon friendly lips doth rise:
1239	Yet sometimes banished hopes will rise
2807	The Larinas were since sunrise
 438	Late in the afternoon to rise,
 424	The shopman and the pedlar rise
4555	The crowd doth head and shoulders rise
4457	He has returned, say in what guise?
1177	Olga the tea must supervise--
  56	He is a charming youth and wise.
3071	Olga began to long likewise
4455	"Is he the same or grown more wise?
2775	The chief of the Chaldean wise,
 756	Man--forty years long in this wise--
 682	But now a question in this wise

3928	With his exasperated sense,
1999	May be the empire of the sense,
4897	He well-nigh lost the use of sense,
3167	Pervaded with much common sense.
1550	And I admired their common sense
 963	Reduced with effort unto sense,
2039	Though now my love might be intense,
4532	Inspired but weariness intense;
 964	We hear with interest intense
 277	Phials of crystal scents enclose.
4549	Ladies in crowds around her close,
 968	A curious interest disclose
3407	Malignant fury they disclose,
3466	The windows whitened, shutters close--

3808	But nowhere can she find repose,
4630	Do agitate his late repose.
1418	Deprive our schoolgirls of repose,
 957	Ne'er trusted to the treacherous ace.When, wise at length, we seek repose
1202	And where at last his bones repose
 374	But better loved the soft repose
2158	Her smile and maidenly repose,
2346	The pine-torch, by her crackles bright.Already crisp hoar frosts impose
3591	Years to light rhyme themselves oppose,
 172	He enters. High the cork arose
 641	And the conviction soon arose,
2723	Furious he from the table rose;
4894	Of thankless friends the circle rose,
2348	(Readers expect the rhyme of _rose_,
3590	Years have inclined me to stern prose,
2958	As many dinners I rehearse,
2704	Barking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse,

 896	They met. Earth, water, prose and verse,
 309	And also that my feeble verse--
  87	Although we read him heaps of verse.

 785	Most usually a Cossack horse
2311	A fiery, yet well-broken horse,
3063	Departed, ordered out his horse

3062	At womankind he growled a curse,
  85	Existence would not make a curse,
1824	Am I to go through the whole list?""How dull you are this morning, nurse!"
 783	All visited him at first, of course;
2312	A dinner, whimsical each course,
5067	Of friends the grateful intercourse--
2338	Snorts, and his rider bends his course
5068	Oh, many a year hath run its course
 353	I lift a warning voice because
 376	I once forgot for your sweet cause
 377	The thirst for fame and man's applause,
3232	The foaming Lenski would refuse,
1677	Now I am ready to refuse.
1257	Whose memory doth not refuse
1814	But look you--ah! do not refuse."
1471	With sudden flush her cheeks suffuse,
1010	Poetic transport did infuse,
4872	Ideas, desires and woes confuse
1417	The monsters of the British Muse
1256	Admirer of the peaceful Muse,
1012	A mournful temper on his Muse.
2281	By other thoughts be occupied.But I the products of my Muse,
4427	Now for the first time I my Muse
2269	Incited by his stormy Muse
1674	But I must now employ my Muse
 349	Ye mothers also, caution use,
 911	One instrument for his own use--
3463	Now, as in a deserted house,
1136	Then became busy with the house,
2047	"What can be drearier than the house,
4747	Received him freely at her house,
2131	Besides the hobbies of a spouse
1135	Night separated from her spouse,
2049	Deplores a most unworthy spouse
 345	So hearken, every worthy spouse,
 346	I would your vigilance arouse,
 423	The drum already doth arouse.
2283	To my old nurse alone peruse,
2271	But Olga would not such peruse.
4429	Her steppe-like beauties I peruse
4870	But what results? His eyes peruse
2085	Even as Moscow, city proud.Confess, O ye who this peruse,
1330	They long ago had held debate.
2239	They would not solemnly debate
1253	My famous portrait indicate
1943	But this amusement delicate
5026	I married--now, I supplicate--
3429	    Indifferent and sedate,
1946	The Lovelaces are out of date,
 749	All this I know is out of date,
  91	That is, he could elucidate
2439	Told me to ask you. Ere that date
2450	In fresh discourse. Such, love, thou art!He was most gay. The happy date
2267	The story of thy life and fate.
5025	Indifferent was her future fate.
1329	On Lenski's matrimonial fate
3804	Afar is borne by cruel fate,
3577	She muses: "What was Olga's fate?
 407	My spirit with such pangs before.Another time, so willed it Fate,
4110	Condemned to exile dire by fate,
1249	Will not, preserved by kindly Fate,
 776	The peasant blessed his happy fate.
2532	The servants used to congregate
2042	Tend not my heart to mitigate,
1843	The hostess doth interrogate:
 324	He nears a spacious mansion's gate,
 524	Both were expectant of the hate
1277	"Your fashionable world I hate,
4659	By the coarse wit of worldly hate;
4231	With her they did associate,
 521	Both were of passion satiate
1621	Excruciate the heart and late
2266	Sometime collected, shall relate
  71	But if the truth I must relate,
1490	"But tell me, nurse, can you relate
1844	"He hath neglected us of late."--
3711	The time for mystic strolls which late
 140	Desirous to annihilate
1650	In charming fashion mutilate?
 138	Lessons to give he understood!How soon he learnt to titillate
4660	But round the hostess scintillate
2480	That year the autumn season late
3823	Two hearts perchance were desolate
1487	But now my mind is desolate,
3578	Longtime was her heart desolate
 836	Shall surely, be it soon or late,
  73	A mild quotation to translate,
1019	A promenade in twilight late
1603	And you, O maids immaculate,
4232	Squeeze tiny hands and osculate;
2014	But I came not to adulate:
5044	The world enough. Congratulate
4656	And jests doth recapitulate.
4540	Reserved, but not inanimate,
3504	Conscious of death approximate,
2421	Just at the hour we designate
 276	And, joy of souls effeminate,
 325	By many a lamp illuminate,
3470	Sweet to behold him obstinate,
3320	Of life or death predestinate.
1734	I had found my predestinate,
3640	And stupid censors passionate;
2063	Perchance one more affectionate.
4915	He marmot-like did hibernate,
5041	Must be pronounced unfortunate--
1711	But if my lot unfortunate
 409	And grasp a stirrup fortunate--
4502	'Tis fearful to anticipate
3805	For evermore is separate.
2531	The Larinas would celebrate,
1647	To whom your hearts were consecrate,--
1018	To whom we used to consecrate
 833	That chosen heroes consecrate,
4539	Her manners were deliberate,
3638	Spoiled children most degenerate
2043	But merely to exasperate;
1712	You in the least commiserate
4908	Or "Idol mio," and in the grate
4916	His double sashes and his grate,
 771	If but to lighten Time's dull rate,
2420	When o'er a glass with friends we prate
 884	Shifts, tacks about, until they prate
3317	The fatal bullet penetrate,
4059	Where turmoil cannot penetrate,
 775	By an _obrok's_ indulgent rate:
1930	To-day, my friends, at any rate,
2015	Your frankness I shall compensate
1622	With jealous fire resuscitate,
4111	On thee I used to meditate!
1604	Whom vice, if named, doth agitate
1247	Rescue me from oblivion.Perchance some heart 'twill agitate,
 752	The matter did not agitate,
4505	Eternally to imitate
2452	The secrets of the marriage state
1192	By rank as settled by the State.
 885	The sorrows of a single state.
4056	These take their seats; the coach of state
1931	I am not strong enough to state;
3468	God knows! The very trace is lost.'Tis sweet the foe to aggravate
2392	My heart of old would captivate.
2061	My soul I cannot renovate--
2477	The Fete
2437	They have invited you this week.""Me?"--"Yes! It is Tattiana's fete
3509	In bud of promise incomplete,
4143	The weary way still incomplete,
 706	Around my stanzas incomplete
3908	Wrapt in oblivion complete,
5079	Without them Eugene is complete;
3142	Encountered punishment complete,
5086	Who the romance do not complete,
1599	With tears, confused emotions, bliss,--With unanimity complete,
4654	With this unpleasant _tete-a-tete_,
4604	Nor yet her lip compressed did bite.
 939	The fervid poet would recite,
2272	When poets lachrymose recite
 873	Was certainly not erudite
1007	Grew like a lily pure and white,
4574	Though dazzling its effulgence white,
2313	A bottle of a vintage white
4910	Winter resigned her empire white,
 389	Beneath the table-cloth of white,
2391	Its ebullition foaming white
2493	All so distinct, and all so white!
4602	Nor sudden turned she red or white,
4297	Their insolence and waistcoats white
4926	Her house he enters, ghastly white,
4249	The converse of the world polite,
4067	Highways all Russia will unite
 694	Happy who thereto can unite
1129	The girl in marriage they unite.
3809	Nor even tears afford respite,
 693	I have endured without respite.
2252	Trembles upon my lips from spite,--
3114	A philosophic anchorite:
3806	She wanders aimless as a sprite,
3113	Who thrives this moment as I write,
3127	But I must add to what I write
2253	And madrigals I'm asked to write!
2234	I would, my friends, inscriptions write,
4081	And irritates the appetite.
3606	At last is shrunk and withered quite?
3069	By Olga stood, dejected quite
1271	A Russian household simple quite,
4966	Affection how did you requite?
 942	Whilst Eugene condescending quite,
1499	For I myself was thirteen quite;
4912	Nor died nor lost his senses quite.
4927	The vestibule finds empty quite--
3181	Lenski his comrade did invite.
 343	Fond declarations they invite
 651	On innocent delights I dote,
3587	I on my chosen hero dote;
 342	On balls I madly used to dote,
4361	'Twas then in valleys lone, remote,
  75	With "vale" finish off a note;
 344	Or the delivery of a note.
1884	She heard of servant-maids the note,
2057	Your innocent and charming note
3941	A dagger, asterisk, or note
2256	To purest love he tuned his note
4362	In spring-time, heard the cygnet's note
1628	The letter which Tattiana wrote.
2056	When in simplicity ye wrote
1220	And an elegiac poem wrote.
2254	But Lenski madrigals ne'er wrote
 316	So let us to the ball-room haste,
3500	And the attendants called in haste.
2868	His chair, plate, knife and fork in haste;
1043	We must admit but little taste
 269	All which in Paris eager taste,
1124	More satisfaction to her taste.
1121	And she despite herself would waste
 272	And ease and fashionable waste,--
1045	And education runs to waste,
 773	This anchorite amid his waste
4156	And exclamations interlaced."Princesse, mon ange!"--"Pachette!"--
2224	Subscribed, _toujours a vous, Annette;_
3887	And the cast-iron statuette
4223	In the beginning, cold and mute,
 799	From whose analysis minute
1289	Whilst homeward by the nearest route
1626	My country's honour and repute
4559	None could a trace of that impute,
1101	Her all in all did constitute;
 809	A wild enthusiastic tongue,
 579	From her my lips shall learn the tongue
1648	Did they not all the Russian tongue
4892	Poltroons and men of slanderous tongue,
  72	Oneguine knew enough, the rogue
  70	Latin is just now not in vogue,
1027	Her locks were of a golden hue,
1026	Her eyes were of cerulean blue,
3822	Like smoke athwart the heaven blue;
3667	The heavens shone in deeper blue,
 823	He racked his brains to find its clue
3979	"Alas! my friend, no revenue!"
1619	His vanity first let us pique
5062	Thou also, my ideal true,
3276	Ah! it may be, affection true
3964	'Tis time to marry her, 'tis true,
4968	No novelty--is it not true?--
4977	"Then, in the country, is't not true?
4979	I did not please you. Why pursue
5027	For ever your Tattiana leave.
1242	Without the faintest trace to leave
1152	And all without her husband's leave.
5039	But now our hero we must leave
1245	My mournful fate in verse to weave,
2177	Into delicious bondage gave
 509	Antiquity no pleasure gave,
1742	But promise of our meeting gave,
2394	Was it not so?--for thee I gave,
3750	And, by the light the moonbeams gave,
4372	A first success light pinions gave,
 935	The prejudices all men have,
3478	At his pale brow a shot to have,
 854	As thoughts which gentle maidens have,
1513	Tell me at once what wilt thou have?
4033	Her shoulders, breast and face to lave--
2175	My heroine, Tattiana dear.Vladimir, hourly more a slave
 852	Charming with grave simplicity.He sang of love--to love a slave.
5004	To shallow sentiment a slave!
5003	A prudent man like you and brave
 936	The fatal secrets of the grave,
4374	And blest me, sinking to the grave.
1744	My guardian angel to the grave.
3477	For him an honourable grave,
3751	Lament, embrace upon that grave.
4275	But where Melpomene doth rave
 510	The moderns of the ancients rave--
1512	The Lord deliver her and save!
2395	And thy inebriating wave
4277	And her bespangled robe doth wave
1267	Thus to assassinate the eve?"--
4693	But my Oneguine the whole eve
3260	To mention the foregoing eve,
4695	Not the young timid maid, believe,
2139	To standards in which we believe?
2115	These are your relatives, believe:
3258	Beside his Olga doth he grieve,
5040	Just at a moment which I grieve
1151	When angry beat her maids, I grieve,
3196	A timid, shrinking love to grieve.
4169	He called upon me Christmas Eve--
1851	Shrill sang the _samovar_ at eve,
3195	To jest as he had done last eve,
5030	I love you--to what end deceive?--
4479	That we by cant ourselves deceive,
2137	Where is he who doth not deceive?
4476	And that too often we receive
2114	What I by relatives conceive?
1268	"Not at all."--"That I can't conceive!
1853	In clouds of steam above perceive.
1216	To me he would his Olga give,
4547	Of "comme il faut." Shishkoff, forgive!
 927	Time without me will lessons give,
1778	But I await thee: scarce alive
 288	The most industrious man alive
1217	Would whisper: shall I so long live?"--
 928	So meantime let him joyous live
3413	Depart in peace and friendly live?
1233	And our successors soon shall drive
3410	Mutual destruction to contrive.
2109	And yet he in your cause would strive
 712	When that time comes, a poem I'll strive
 290	What boots it with the age to strive?
 199	Applause, the people's donative.
4548	I can't translate the adjective.
 200	There our Katenine did revive
1779	My heart with but one look revive;
4554	Along the hall, and high above
2547	That guests approach: and when above
1017	The moon, the lamp of heaven above,
 691	None, be my witness Heaven above!
  17	By the decree of Mighty Jove,
3461	And enmity and hope and love--
3676	O Spring, thou chosen time of love!
1013	Farewell! thou golden days of love!
1590	The all-entrancing joys of love--
1940	To swagger as the art of love,
2183	And what resulted? Drunk with love,
 740	Extended--haunt which Dryads love.
 952	By absence who hath chilled his love,
2062	I love you with a brother's love,
1020	With tears which secret sufferers love--
 692	The malady of hopeless love
2060	This lot in life with stern decree?"Ideas and time ne'er backward move;
3678	My spirit and my blood doth move,
 955	Whom jealous transport cannot move,
4553	Maidens before her meekly move
  15	Thus mused a madcap young, who drove
1014	'Twas then he loved the tangled grove
 739	A thick immense neglected grove
2182	Around the meadow and the grove.
  42	And in the Summer Garden rove.
  41	Gently for pranks he would reprove
2186	If Olga smilingly approve,
1939	Time was when cold seduction strove
1591	Young ladies, if ye ever strove
4639	Vexation? Vanity? or strove
3462	The blood boiled and the passions strove.
2181	At morn, hand clasped in hand, they rove
2544	Lo! the prim cat upon the stove
1069	Desire to rule ye may observe
1072	Polite demeanour to preserve,
4295	To strike imagination serve.
4294	Young ladies in a vasty curve,
2708	Him who inspired both love and awe,
2644	With footsteps tremulous with awe
1548	Striking the intellect with awe
2953	And supper. In the country we
3791	When the hour came to bid good-bye--
5060	Now we must separate. Good-bye!
4055	To bid the gentlefolk good-bye.
3999	"Ye peaceful valleys all, good-bye!
3443	His hand, and fell. His clouded eye
4824	To arm the tongue and e'en the eye,
2360	Walking? The landscape tires the eye
 350	Upon your daughters keep an eye,
3570	And reads with rapid eager eye
3435	To raise his pistol to his eye,
2578	Tattiana gazed with curious eye
 717	I've scanned it with a jealous eye,
3438	And Lenski, closing his left eye,
4093	The verst posts catch the vacant eye
1051	The cynosure of every eye.
 144	But ye, O happy husbands, ye
4922	Whither along them doth he pelt?Oneguine whither gallops? Ye
2472	Whose brain no fond illusions daze,
4069	On iron bridges we shall gaze
3877	On everything around her gaze,
4318	Looks upon all with absent gaze
3798	Tattiana gently led them there.And long her eyes as through a haze
 708	Extinguished ashes do not blaze--
 400	No, never in the early blaze
 221	On pit, stalls, boxes, brightly blaze,
3381	"But," cried Zaretski in amaze,
 370	Do ye of spring the blossoms graze?
 368	Madman, wilt thou from memory raze
 252	Still they blow noses, cough, and sneeze,
3632	Let not the poet's spirit freeze,
4521	Him a disquietude did seize,
3102	A hand of ice appeared to seize
4032	Nor the first snow of winter seize
2709	The hero we immortalize.
4937	Who now could fail to recognize
1466	Confront thy fated torturer!Love's pangs Tattiana agonize.
 866	Gifts such as these alone could prize,
2575	Having lost all in life we prize.
4004	The calm existence which I prize
2639	A bristly bear of monstrous size!
 640	They made him feel inclined to doze;
3569	Aside she casts her veil of gauze
2143	And who is not a tiresome thief?
2037	And honestly 'tis my belief
2408	Is ever ready with relief,
1141	This great discovery relief
1139	By Heaven in lieu of happiness.Habit alleviates the grief
2407	Who in the agony of grief
2142	To whom are our misfortunes grief
1200	With deeper woe than others' grief.
2038	Our union would produce but grief.
3654	                    Dmitrieff
2832	Who arrived lately from Tamboff,
3660	    Griboyedoff
3082	Loud snores the cumbrous Poustiakoff
3084	Gvozdine, Bouyanoff, Petoushkoff
2830	The family of Kharlikoff,
4587	But stop! I will present thee, if
 672	To write of any other elf
2306	Then dressed himself...
1055	Stood as estranged from all aloof,
1054	Even beneath her parents' roof
2831	Came with Monsieur Triquet, a prig,
2833	In spectacles and chestnut wig.
1993	The language of her girlish pleading
2765	Page after page continued reading,
1991	However, Tania's letter reading,
2763	Whom you in slumber may have seen."But she, her sister never heeding,
 227	Istomina the nimbly-bounding;
 226	Forth from the crowd of nymphs surrounding
1900	Espy him approaching,
1392	Farthingales, patches, were the thing,
1832	Oneguine's letter!"--"Ah! the thing!
1695	I guard it as a holy thing,
3310	I have it. Lo! the very thing!
4043	Basins and jugs--well! everything
4269	Also one Viazemski, remarking
4272	And an old gent the poet marking
 194	Shone pungent Satire's dauntless king,
2470	As butterflies to blossoms cling.
1835	But why are your cheeks whitening?"
1697	I'm o'er it ever pondering.
1391	The world is ever altering!
2856	And chattering loud sit down to dine.Ceased for a space all chattering.
2858	Plates, knives and forks are clattering
2469	Or, parable more flattering,
 444	Amidst successes flattering
4341	To our Tattiana conquering,
3560	Upon the meadows showering,
3699	Some other long-departed Spring,
3312	Ye golden days of my young spring?
 443	Free, in the blossom of his spring,
2459	In life domestic see a string
3562	Of Volga fishermen doth sing,
4343	That I forget not whom I sing.
2218	Behold! orthography despising,
 282	Rousseau, I would remark in passing,
 285	Eloquent raver all-surpassing,--
1502	At last my father gave his blessing,
1501	Her suit before my parents pressing:
4208	Then the old dames in chorus sing,
 134	Attentive to the heart's first beating,
 135	Follow up love--a secret meeting
4044	To happiness contributing.
3698	Wafted upon poetic wing,
2051	The tiresome man, her value knowing,
2460	Of pictures painful harrowing,
2052	Yet curses on his fate bestowing,
 196	And Kniajnine, apt at copying.
2219	Metreless verses recognizing
1170	Existence calmly sped along,
 697	Who following Petrarch move along
3861	A riding whip. She strolls along.
1491	The days which to your youth belong?
5072	Glittered in a perspective long,
4629	Visions, now sad, now grateful, long
3858	She gazed--a cue, forgotten long,
4348	And grant success to labour long;
 495	He thought to write, but labour long
4882	The lively trash of stories long
1504	Weeping they loosed my tresses long
3734	The nightingale there all night long,
3742	"_The date, his fleeting years how long--
4281	Terpsichore alone among
 498	And thus he never fell among
4391	And wild festivities among

1649	With little knowledge and that wrong
3743	Repose in peace, thou child of song_."
4392	She brought with her the gift of song.
1898	With dance and with song.
1505	And led me off to church with song."
2520	Either with him or thee in song,
3735	Spring's paramour, pours forth her song
 696	A double force unto their song
 686	Of maids dost thou inscribe thy song?
4344	Let me explain that in my song
 810	Black curls which to his shoulders hung.
4351	Enough! my pack is now unslung--

1067	Would she the canvas tight enrich
1486	In monsters and fair dames was rich;
3134	Who to surrender did not blench
3131	Drunk as a fly; and thus the French
3480	But home his body to despatch
1068	With gay design and silken stitch.
2773	Ever absorbed a maid so much:
1032	I formerly admired her much
4751	No coquetry was there, I vouch--
1031	You'll find her portrait there, I vouch;
2772	Nor the _Journal des Modes_, I vouch,
4752	Society endures not such!
 166	'Tis dark. He seats him in a sleigh,
3519	Ye shadows of a life more high,
1739	My doom has been pronounced on high,
3055	With great delight.--O God on high!
1815	"I call to witness God on high--"
1475	Sails her allotted course on high,
2330	And many a caravan on high
2325	The tiny sun shone less on high
4107	Of churches, gardens, belfries high
4000	Ye well-known mountain summits high,
1692	Careless of fame his spirit high
1476	And from the misty woodland nigh
4016	And golden Autumn draweth nigh,
2877	With effort she restrains. Well nigh
1923	But scarce had turned the corner nigh,
2600	List! the snow crunches--he draws nigh!
3319	Good governs all! The hour draws nigh
1597	When separation's hour drew nigh,
1921	A sportsman who in covert lies.But finally she heaves a sigh,
 946	And, heaving a regretful sigh,
 471	Nor tender glance nor amorous sigh
3899	Heaved an involuntary sigh
3754	There is no wreath upon the bough:
2508	In scenes like these it may be though,
1296	How dark the night is getting though!
3457	His breast was riddled through and through,
4578	And the eternal lorgnette through
1264	To guess how you the eve pull through."--
2144	My venerated reader, oh!
2428	They sent their compliments--but oh!
 336	Spurs of the Cavalier Guard clash,
 339	Full many a glance like lightning flash,
3046	And pressed her hand--the crimson blush
3045	Some madrigal not worth a rush,
3491	He lies, upon his forehead death,
3350	Was sleeping then a sleep like death;
3747	Above the humble urn of death.
2230	_Affectionately yours till death_.
 607	Or counting on his uncle's death
3740	Who early died a gallant death_,"
3490	When motionless your gaze beneath

3220	But lo! his braggart neighbour hath
3049	Seen all, beside himself with wrath,
3218	Impatient, boiling o'er with wrath,
3395	Zaretski bit his lip in wrath,
3486	Or even overcome by wrath
3396	But to Vladimir Eugene saith:
1587	Without the ken of parents both,
4459	What doth he act? Is it Melmoth,
  11	Beneath his head the pillow smooth,
3612	I must resign myself, in sooth;
 531	But memory like a serpent's tooth

1460	And thou shalt taste the joys of earth.
1459	To dire contentment shall give birth
4619	He salutary rules poured forth?
 167	"Drive on!" the cheerful cry goes forth,
2943	Behold! green tables are brought forth,
2396	Full many a foolish prank brought forth;
 169	By the fine silver of the north.
  80	For him were but of little worth,
4618	Impelled by zeal for moral worth,
2393	The last poor obol I was worth--
2946	Ombre, and whist all others worth:
3604	Where youth ?
4782	Restrained the impulses of youth;
1589	To the impressions of our youth,
3614	My frivolous and jolly youth.
2028	Found the ideal of my youth,
4781	But, knowing not the actual truth,
2029	Thee only would I choose, in truth,

1720	To listen to the words you speak,
 893	Vows matrimonial to break,
3952	A Russian in Childe Harold's cloak,
3140	Openly or 'neath decent cloak.
2411	All hail! my good old friend Bordeaux!The fire sinks low. An ashy cloak
2840	And the sagacious Triquet back
2504	Himself transformed into a hack;
2645	Passes the torrent But alack!
2503	Placed in a sledge his terrier black,
  63	In truth he had the happy trick
3700	Whose memories make the heart beat quick
1845	Tattiana blushed, her heart beat quick--
4713	And he had made her heart beat quick!
3138	He loved the simpleton to mock,
1624	The artful prisoner should seek
1618	And thus secures the prey we seek.
4712	Autocrat of the drawing-room seek?
3697	Or, it may be, we inly seek,
1718	At times, if only once a week,
2303	His Hellespont from bank to bank,
4928	He enters the saloon. 'Tis blank!
2304	And then a cup of coffee drank,
4929	A door he opens. But why shrank
1877	Till out of breath upon a seatShe sank.--
 792	He's a freemason, so we think.
1312	An oval countenance and pink,
1313	Yon silly moon upon the brink
 793	Alone he doth his claret drink,
3304	Vladimir closes up his book,
2754	Was uttered, and the cabin shook--
2747	His fist Oneguine fiercely shook
3868	Into accounts would sometimes look,
2929	But somehow there shone in his look
 123	How bright and tender was his look,
3249	To flight before her radiant look,
4971	Calling to mind your icy look
4323	The little solitary nook
2301	His course unto the running brook.
4709	Which crushing dignity must brook!
4324	Where shining runs the tiny brook,
3867	'Tis here he slept, his coffee took,
4707	How thoroughly her part she took!
3307	And flowed harmoniously. He took
4274	To ask her name the trouble took.
2300	And clad in airy costume took
4974	An honourable course ye took,
3248	Jealousy and vexation took
4855	Caught him and by the collar took
2200	Till absently Vladimir took
3561	The shepherd plaits his shoe of bark,
2598	But trembling on the mirror dark
2599	The sad moon only could remark.
3559	A simple tombstone hath been set.There, when the rains of spring we mark
1311	'Tis a Madonna of Vandyk,
4441	Assemblies oligarchical
4226	They deem her somewhat finical,
4638	Of a heart cold and cynical?
3705	Ye men of fashion cynical,
2883	And female tears hysterical,
4756	Already he grew phthisical.
 480	Harmless, but quite nonsensical.
4675	Economy political,
 295	A fop, in dress pedantical.
 971	And cannot anything conceal,
 385	Of untold gain she must conceal,
3027	When the mazurka used to peal,
3314	In vain my anxious eyes appeal;
3679	What sad emotions o'er me steal
3313	What will the coming dawn reveal?
 384	For promises her feet reveal
4227	Outlandish and provincial,
4312	Her glance how wild yet genial!
4676	And with gray hair ambrosial
4309	Lo! with what pride celestial
3034	Nought of its charms original
4769	Yet suffering emotional
 821	He deemed of human life the goal
 842	The path which leads to glory's goal.
1228	And others rise ephemeral!
4330	The eyes of a grave general.
4538	Behind her a grave general.
3001	A ball in Peter's capital,
 101	In one thing really did excel.
 973	The love, hate, sorrow, joy, we feel.
3680	When first upon my cheek I feel
3029	The parquet cracked beneath the heel,
 278	Combs of all sizes, files of steel,
 645	On him spleen mounted sentinel
1557	To such--delightful to repel.
2872	Lifts not her eyes which swimming fail.
3337	Though of romance therein I fail
3932	With eye precise and without fail.
3585	In time I'll give ye without fail
4030	Winter's approach she doth not hail
3930	The sharp incisions of his nail,
3557	Within its wave the sounding pail,
2671	She runs, the bear upon her trail,
2552	Across the gloom of heaven would sail
 617	Sorrow to counterfeit and wail--
3673	Herds low, and under night's dark veil
1653	God grant I meet not at a ball
4683	Another tribune of the ball
 466	To slay himself with blade or ball,
 994	Nor study, banquet, rout nor ball
4328	Forgot the world, the noisy ball,
 479	Yet as a rule their talk I call
1163	She soon forgot, began to call
 294	Was that which we are wont to call
3170	So, when he came next day to call,
2712	He drinks, all drink and loudly call;
4443	The rigour of cold pride and all
 745	Lofty the chambers one and all,
 397	Enamoured at her feet to fall.
 242	And finally he deigns let fall
1227	They blossom, ripen and they fall
4536	A whisper runs along the hall,
3077	Assigned a lodging, from the hall
2811	Crush and confusion in the hall,
1252	Some future ignoramus shall
 245	Exclaiming, "We must change 'em all!
2885	For long he had endured them all.
 991	Nor years of separation all
3076	Bedding is laid out and to all
 467	Indifferent he became to all,
4023	A white and undulating pall
4021	Came forth in all her magic sheen.The snow descends and buries all,
1162	Her sentimental verses all,
3885	The twilight pale which softens all,
3703	'Tis now the season! Idlers all,
  40	Morality taught scarce at all;
2863	They shout and no one lists at all.
3171	Was not surprised thereby at all.
2714	He knits his brows--'tis silent all.
 395	I envied sore the billows tall,
 746	Silk tapestry upon the wall,
3886	Lord Byron's portrait on the wall
4684	Hung like a print against the wall,
2814	Shouts, laughter, jamming 'gainst the wall,
3890	Long in this fashionable cell
3332	For consecrate to me he fell
4595	The lady's glance upon him fell--
4786	Lenski, unhappy victim, fell,
3144	Himself just like a greenhorn fell.
1554	The inscription o'er the gates of Hell
1670	Repentance wields not now her spell
3626	Of languor and of love did tell
2088	'Twas not the first time, I can tell
2113	For your instruction here to tell
 609	The steward sent a note to tell
1519	And crossed with trembling hand the maid."I am in love," her whispers tell
1516	I am--in love--you know--don't tell!"
1818	Unto our neighbour. Mind you tell--
2424	But lo! the friends to chat commence."How are our neighbours fair, pray tell,
2823	Who from two years to thirty tell;
4488	At thirty who was married well,
2148	A worthy object 'tis, and well
  99	I have no leisure here to dwell,
 642	Ennui can in the country dwell
3331	And think: here lies who loved me well,
4002	Thou beauteous sky above, farewell!
 611	And wished to say to him farewell.
3624	And rest from bygone days of strife.But pause! Thou calm retreats, farewell,
2426	"The family are all quite well--
2111	Are all your relatives quite well?
1515	How thy hands burn!"--"Dear nurse, I'm well.
1817	To take this letter to O-- Well!
4001	Ye groves whose depths I know so well,
 279	Scissors both straight and curved as well,
4594	His relative and friend as well.
1671	And gallicisms I love as well
3143	And sometimes into snares as well
4785	This separated us as well--
2824	Petoushkoff, the provincial swell;
4487	At twenty who was prig or swell,
1521	"My heart's delight, thou art not well."--
5028	Your heart possesses, I know well,
2086	Oneguine acted very well
1276	"Boredom, my friend, behold the ill--"
1441	My unpretending page shall fill,
3621	Of thy delights I drank my fill,
3832	Proceeds, until she from a hill
 811	The pervert world with icy chill
2339	And wisely gallops to the hill.
3730	Let us proceed unto a rill,
1443	By the old lime-tree or the rill,
4009	'Tis now the hillock now the rill
 637	To listen to the rippling rill.
3835	A garden by a shining rill.
1294	"'Tis habit, Lenski."--"Is your ill
4144	An hour passed by--another--till,
 813	His heart reciprocated still
4146	The coach before a house stood still.
1278	Domestic life attracts me still,
1293	"How now, Oneguine, yawning still?"--
1398	Or couplets more ingenious still;
3732	Seeks, winding amid meadows still,
 635	To wander through the meadows still,
3620	With tumult or contentment still
2070	You fall in love again. But still--
1395	Time was, the poet's tender quill
2340	No more at dawn the shepherd will
1984	Thus a guest with composure will
4011	To stay the maid against her will.
2069	'Tis evidently Heaven's will
1543	Indites an inconsiderate scroll
2068	As in their turn the seasons roll.
 699	Perchance they laurels also cull--
2582	Rings from a dish of water full
2700	Perched on a goose's neck a skull
2583	In order due the maidens pull;
1834	You know that I am now a fool--
3199	At eighteen not to play the fool!
 815	He was a dear delightful fool--
4768	He used to hate--and was no fool--
 816	A nursling yet for Hope to school.
3202	Conventionality's dull tool--
2071	Learn to possess more self-control.
  37	"Monsieur l'Abbe" a starving Gaul,
2698	A shape half cat and half a crane.Yet ghastlier, yet more wonderful,
1542	And Eugene ever in her soul
 820	Would soothe the doubtings of his soul,
 840	And now philanthropy his soul,
1833	Now don't be cross with me, my soul,
4798	Of your perfections in my soul,
2973	But my Tattiana, on my soul,
2862	They laugh, they argue, and they bawl,
1655	A schoolmaster in yellow shawl
4766	A love epistle he doth scrawl.
4635	He a polite reply doth scrawl.
1532	Enchanted by the moon's pale beam.
3876	Deep in our mother Earth's chill breast!"Tattiana's eyes with tender gleam
1857	And a boy handed round the cream.
3326	The memory of the bard, a dream,
4242	But Tania just as in a dream
1881	Guards fondly hope's uncertain dream.
1531	Whilst all creation seemed to dream
 770	Eugene at first began to dream,
 981	The story of his young love's dream,
2278	To the fair object of his dream,
1439	I will descant on love's sweet dream,
 565	But sweeter in a midnight dream
1464	Of happy meetings thou shalt dream,
1062	E'en from her cradle's earliest dream,
1767	All this may be an empty dream,
5070	Tattiana in a misty dream,
1461	Thou'lt quaff love's sweet envenomed stream,
2355	Thinking to float upon the stream,
1856	The fragrant tea in darkling stream,
1064	Of rural life the sluggish stream;
3327	Will be absorbed by Lethe's stream;
1250	Perish absorbed by Lethe's stream.
3897	Our youthful wanderer should roam.
 583	Awaiting on the shore I roam
4522	A wish from place to place to roam,
3788	Back to his regiment must roam.
4566	'Twould serve ye in an epigram--
2251	And a malicious epigram
2453	And love's delicious diadem
1879	Merciful God, what will he deem?"
 566	Torquato Tasso's strains I deem.
1269	'Tis something of this sort I deem.
1769	Providence otherwise may deem--
3878	Of priceless value all things seem
4241	With mute appeal to ask they seem--
   3	He hath acquired the world's esteem
1107	But, as he never opened them,
2451	In three weeks would arrive for them;
3430	The foes, as yet not taking aim,
 972	Is ever ready to proclaim
1038	With such a perversity proclaim.
3125	And true, his pistol's faultless aim
4685	Pink as Palm Sunday cherubim,
2361	In winter by its blank and dim
4612	Cast upwards then her eyeballs dim
4326	And the lime alley's twilight dim
 859	Of what not, and of distant dim,
4609	But could not. Then she questioned him:--
  66	Silent, oracular ye'd see him
 284	Dared calmly cleanse his nails 'fore him,
2500	Its driver seated on the rim
2217	From first to last page to the rim.
 858	He sang of separation grim,
4686	Motionless, mute, tight-laced and trim.
2215	A country damsel's album trim,
2501	In scarlet sash and sheepskin trim;
 283	Could not conceive how serious Grimm
4524	In some a willing martyrdom.
3968	And lonely through the forest creeps.""Is she in love?" quoth one. "With whom?
1344	She waited for--I don't know whom!
3970	Petoushkoff met the selfsame doom.
1193	Thus age approached, the common doom,
3736	The fountain brawls, sweetbriers bloom,
3268	Perish when half disclosed its bloom!"--
2157	Her health, life's sweetness and its bloom,
1224	Oh! on the fields of life how bloom
3774	Was the sad poet filled with gloom,
1343	Had filled her youthful breast with gloom,
2327	The forests in mysterious gloom
3866	This is my master's sitting-room.
3081	All slumber. In the drawing-room
4610	"Had he been long here, and where from?
2642	She nerves herself from her alarm
2643	And leans upon the monster's arm,

5074	Distinctly not its mechanism.
5073	And I discerned through Fancy's prism
4900	Indeed, by force of magnetism
4904	How like a poet was my chum
4907	He "Benedetta" used to hum,
3919	He had excepted from the ban:
3366	Dressing as quickly as he can,
 715	Meantime I'll finish whilst I can

3110	A new acquaintance we must scan.
4228	A trifle pale, a trifle lean,
3434	Oneguine slowly then began
3942	Interrogation to denote.And my Tattiana now began
3378	Zaretski, village mechanician,
 882	Suitable for this semi-Russian.
 713	To write in cantos twenty-five.I've thought well o'er the general plan,
  19	Friends of Liudmila and Ruslan,
1496	"How came you then to wed a man?"--
3112	Vladimir's property, a man
  32	At last became a ruined man.
3944	More clearly, God be praised, the man,
  20	Let me present ye to the man,
1201	He was an honest gentleman,
3917	Long ceased to be a reading man,
1204	_Demetrius Larine, sinful man,
3923	Portrayed contemporary man

3433	Four deadly paces do they span;
4807	I feel, allotted is my span;
  30	Deep into debt his father ran;
 760	Two cupboards, table, soft divan,

 142	How bitterly he would malign,
4671	With roses, caps and looks malign;
 293	Dreading the world's remarks malign,
2711	And viewed the door with cunning eye.All bustle when he makes a sign:
2205	Landscapes thereon he would design,
3148	At times talk nonsense with design;
1784	But boldly I myself resign:
1738	My heart's allegiance can resign,
2855	Men opposite. The cross they sign
1255	My gratitude do not disdain,
1710	To crush me with a just disdain.
2064	Listen to me without disdain.
4305	And she to whom my lyre would fain,
 264	Dressed him, undressed, and dressed again?
 357	Should dearly like a dance again.
4060	Shall I behold thee once again?"--
2003	But to the garden once again
1572	The youthful lover once again
3068	Oneguine, bored to death again,
2697	A dwarf adorned with tail, again
4514	Oneguine--take him up again--
2121	That until Christmas comes again
 121	Of love again, and yet again;
2065	A maid hath oft, may yet again
1240	And agitate my heart again;
2932	Or if he meant to flirt again,
2013	It wakens in my breast again.
2716	Tattiana courage doth regain
2016	By an avowal just as plain.
2715	He there is master--that is plain;
3186	Zaretski rose, nor would explain,
4957	Without disguise ourselves explain.
3817	Detest him for a brother slain?
3547	Alas! the youthful lover slain,
3584	By whom the youthful bard was slain?"--
1562	Who selfishly unmoved remain
1708	Can lower depths beyond remain?
4221	As deaf and silly doth remain,
4762	He obstinately will remain,
4808	But, that life longer may remain,
1109	And gave himself but little pain
1241	And thus it is 'twould cause me pain
4980	Me now, inflict upon me pain?--
 989	And an habitual sense of pain;
2146	Spare yourself unavailing pain
1511	"My darling child, thou art in pain.--
4841	Where, where, remorse, compassion, pain?
2931	I know not if his heart felt pain
 458	And, though a plucky scatterbrain,
4038	Kibitkas three, the accustomed train,
2768	The bard's enthusiastic strain,
2990	Of bassoons and of flutes the strain.
3799	After the wedded couple strain;
4838	Oh, how her lips compressed restrain
1510	Behold, my sobs I scarce restrain--"
4306	Yet dares not, dedicate its strain,
2790	The dream left terror in its train.
2585	A ring she heard the ancient strain:
4513	Or e'en the "Demon" of my strain.
2792	Tania the meaning would obtain
 504	A case of books he doth obtain--
4965	I loved you--what did I obtain?
1258	My light productions to retain,
2767	Although her book did not contain
4039	The household property contain:
1110	His daughter's book to ascertain
3016	Pair after pair the race sustain.
3061	Lenski the stroke could not sustain,
 990	And distance interposed in vain,
4763	Still hopes, endeavours, though in vain.
 505	He reads at random, reads in vain.
4978	And far removed from rumour vain;
 355	I've wasted in amusements vain,
2145	Cease the pursuit of shadows vain,
2004	Wherein we lately left the twain.
3064	And galloped home. But pistols twain,
 945	The converse of our hermits twain,
2861	To raise a clamour and a din:
1972	In solitude or worldly din,
1188	Three tears they dropt with humble mein
3174	Ere conversation could begin,
2860	But by degrees the crowd begin
1280	For God's sake, Lenski, don't begin!
 311	With words of foreign origin
3351	The pall of night was growing thin,
2375	At morn an icy bath within
1973	He heard his soul's complaint within,
 253	Still everywhere, without, within,
1279	Where--"--"What! another eclogue spin?
3173	Zaretski with a knowing grin,
 310	Pardon I ask for such a sin--
2672	Until her powers of running fail.She sank upon the snow. But Bruin
1106	In books he saw nought to condemn
4168	"Here, he resides with Simeon.
2693	A canine face with horns thereon,
1368	And that unrivalled paragon,
1076	And gossip of the town and fashion
2127	Agreed! but then the whirl of fashion,
2129	The torrent of opinion,
3215	Behold! the world's opinion!
1074	Recent instructions of its mother.But Tania ne'er displayed a passion
2128	The natural fickleness of passion,
 977	The youthful poet's fond confession.
1429	Shall abdicate the bard's profession,
1427	My friends, what means this odd digression?
 976	With quite a lachrymose expression
 883	He enters: rapidly discussion
  21	Who without more prevarication
  57	We all of us of education
3499	Oneguine went with trepidation
3933	Tattiana saw with trepidation
2889	Cast down his eyes in trepidation
 603	But Eugene, hating litigation
1667	With inexact pronunciation
1445	And tears of reconciliation:
1035	Must now my stanzas occupy.Tattiana was her appellation.
4563	Although it will not bear translation,
1612	The God of Love is after you!A coquette loves by calculation,
3047	Upon her cheek by adulation
3498	Killed! at this dreadful exclamation
4565	Not high in general estimation;
1617	Enhances love in estimation
3050	And hot with jealous indignation,
2890	And sulked in silent indignation;
2793	Of such a dread hallucination.
3629	Invigorate imagination
1339	Long time her young imagination
 518	Original imagination,
1616	She did not think "procrastination
3953	Of foreign whims the impersonation--
2893	Triumphant by anticipation,
1444	Their Jealousy and separation
1661	The fair of the next generation,
 687	Whose glance reflecting inspiration
 921	And eye which gleams with inspiration--
3628	And thou, youth's early inspiration,
1419	The idols of their adoration
1037	In pages of a love narration
  22	The hero is of my narration!
 919	The poet's fervid conversation
1664	Introduce verse in conversation.
 534	A charm with it in conversation.
  64	Without constraint in conversation
2791	Not knowing its interpretation,
2377	Alone within his habitation
1420	A Vampire fond of meditation,
 517	An innate love of meditation,
2378	And buried deep in meditation,
1669	As formerly much agitation.
1342	And long internal agitation
2888	And marking Tania's agitation,
1614	A love which knew no limitation,
3950	Which is he? or an imitation,
 689	Thy meditative incantation--
  59	Thus, praised be God! a reputation
  67	Amid a serious disputation,
 606	Seeing in this no deprivation,
 537	To the sarcastic observation,
3934	By what idea or observation
1582	With intellect and strong volition
1317	Meantime Oneguine's apparition
3376	Lenski the foeman's apparition
1319	Quite a sensation; the position
 724	My very latest composition!
1583	And a determined disposition,
 721	For journalistic deglutition
3780	The same unmoved oblivion
1944	Was worthy of that old baboon,
3829	Beneath the silver of the moon
3895	Behind the mountain sank the moon.
2597	And bends her mirror on the moon,
1534	Tattiana gazes on the moon,
1540	'Tis silent--on her shines the moon--
1474	And now 'tis night, the guardian moon
3244	Well! just as she was yesterday."Why did you leave last night so soon?"
2674	Submissive as if in a swoon,
1112	His wife was also mad upon
1945	Our fathers used to dote upon;
3766	A lancer her soul dotes upon:
2744	His head sinks slowly, rests upon
4877	His spirit was intent upon.
4356	Still for ever fare thee well.'--Byron
2523	Herself not knowing well the reason,
3983	The counsel good and full of reason,
2525	And the cold beauties of the season:
3985	To visit Moscow in the season.
1113	The works of Mr. Richardson.She was thus fond of Richardson
1369	The sleep-compelling Grandison,
1115	Or that adoring Grandison
1386	Was certainly no Grandison.
4165	Cousin, rememb'rest Grandison?"
2594	Sailed silently in unison--
2696	There an imperious skeleton;
3421	The sharp flint, screwed securely on,
2236	My verses, kindly meant, would earn
3255	To ask forgiveness seemed to yearn;
4759	To write his forefathers to warn
3252	He eyed her with a fond concern,
4761	Tattiana--thus the sex is born.--
1108	Viewed them with not a little scorn,
1795	Silvers the brook; the shepherd's horn
 564	A jolly song and distant horn;
1794	Looms gray behind the mist and morn
1839	Pale as a ghost and dressed since morn
1023	And modest, cheerful as the morn,
1111	Which 'neath her pillow lay till morn.
4917	And sallied forth one brilliant morn--
1025	Sweet as the kiss of lovers sworn.
4920	Of the sun glisten; muddy, worn,
3323	Bright day will then begin to burn,
1608	Perchance you also soon may burn,
2462	My wretched Lenski's fate I mourn,
3691	Do we alone our losses mourn
3329	To visit, lovely maid, return,
2237	Delighted glances in return;
3325	Have entered never to return.
3689	Or, heedless of the leaves' return
1609	Then to some gallant in your turn
3328	Men will forget me, but my urn
2803	A load of care upon the maid."But lo! forth from the valleys dun
2505	To freeze his finger hath begun,
2502	Yonder the household lad doth run,
2805	Swift following in her wake, the sun,"
3744	Time was, the breath of early dawn
3746	Hung on a pine branch earthward drawn
2161	As when the tempest's veil is drawn
 219	In silence shall I sit and yawn
2657	There is no path; the storm hath strewn
1732	The untutored spirit's pangs calmed down
1148	Mushrooms for winter salted down,
2654	Their branches by the snow bowed down.
1527	And on the footstool sitting down
2130	And the fair sex as light as down!
2743	Her on a shaky bench sit down;
1743	I feel thou wast by God sent down
1530	The aged nurse in ample gown,
2596	In a half-open dressing-gown
2435	You never since your nose have shown.
2567	Thus her perversity hath shown.
3601	Hopeless are all the first, I own,
 619	But, to his uncle's mansion flown,
3208	The opportunity is flown.
3564	For summer to the country flown,
3599	Upon my visions such intrude.Fresh aspirations I have known,
 951	Still happier he who ne'er hath known!
2322	Glimmers and dies. This is well known,
3209	Besides, a duellist well-known
3341	For o'er a word to fashion known,
1731	And bitter torment never known.
1952	What everybody long has known;
3839	He is not there: I am not known:
1149	Kept the accounts, shaved many a crown,
3769	She bows her head beneath the crown;
1382	On raptures, sorrows not her own,
4500	Have one by one all withered grown
 476	Have latterly vexatious grown;
 950	Hath suffered but indifferent grown,
3422	Is cocked once more. Uneasy grown,
3342	"Ideal," he had drowsy grown.
3894	Slept o'er the river misty grown.
3246	Lenski, into confusion thrown,
3837	Her heart more loudly and more fleet.She hesitates, in doubt is thrown--
4501	Like rotten leaves by Autumn strown--
2320	And town and friends forgotten quite.This northern summer of our own,
  14	When will the devil take his own!"
 826	Impelled to union with his own
 111	Far from his Italy--his own.
3563	And the young damsel from the town,
2979	Troy's sages should in concert own
 474	He left _you_ first, and I must own
2432	Must visit them. Come! you must own,
3965	But tell me what am I to do?
4581	Familiar to him long ago.
2908	Made me so tipsy long ago!
1059	To romp and play she ne'er would go:
3771	Her lips where light smiles come and go!
2941	Matrons unto the fireplace go,
2853	They hand in hand to table go.
 317	Whither at headlong speed doth go
4925	Incorrigible rogue, doth go.
1538	Draw near. I soon to sleep shall go--
1990	Whither that evening he will go.
2481	Kept lingering on as loath to go,
4173	Alas! abroad I cannot go.
1262	"Good-bye, Oneguine, I must go."--
 146	The crafty spouse caressed him, who
 100	But say he was a genius who
4101	But they draw near. Before them, lo!
3121	Yea! and a man of honour, lo!
2296	His daily occupations, lo!
1703	I cannot understand. But lo!
4576	"And is it she? It must be--no--
1286	Present me."--"You are joking."--"No."--
1295	More troublesome than usual?"--"No!
 149	The pompous, swaggering cuckold too,
1537	Pen, paper bring: the table too
 915	And usually despised it too),
1806	My beauty, thou art ready too.
3613	Yet let us part in friendship, O
4360	But would not look at Cicero.
4590	"To--?"--"Larina."--"Tattiana?"--"So.
 496	Inspired him with disgust and so
3397	"Shall we commence?"--"Let it be so,"
4923	Have guessed already. Yes, quite so!
3611	That soon I reach my thirtieth year?And so my noon hath come! If so,
3290	"I'm happy, say, is it not so?"--
3819	No more remembered him; unto
3816	For was it not her duty to
2852	But dinner-time comes. Two and two
4646	Together moments one or two
2784	A grammar, likewise Petriads two,
3425	Zaretski paces thirty-two
1656	Or a professor in tulle cap.
4583	The lady in the crimson cap
1918	When captured in a schoolboy's cap;
3129	He from his Kalmuck horse did leap
4070	Which o'er the waters boldly leap,
3394	He's a straightforward little chap."
1654	Or at a promenade mayhap,
3393	Although unknown to fame mayhap,
1917	With iridescent wing doth flap
3353	His song, when still he slumbered deep,
4071	Mountains we'll level and through deep
2199	Buried in meditation deep,
3830	Long time in meditation deep
 422	Whilst Petersburg from slumber deep
3094	But stares into the darkness deep.
3130	In mud and mire to wallow deep,
1793	Is waning. Yonder valley deep
2854	The maids beside Tattiana keep--
3831	Her path across the plain doth keep--
2364	Your steed, though rough-shod, cannot keep
 420	Are oft deceptive--like their feet.Where is Oneguine? Half asleep,
2468	As drunken tramps at nightfall sleep,
1796	Arouses rustics from their sleep.
3093	My poor Tattiana cannot sleep
 250	Wrapped in their sheepskins soundly sleep.
2196	Far from the rest the pair would creep
2658	Both bush and brake, ravine and steep,
2467	In sensual sweets his soul doth steep
3354	The sun had mounted high his steep,
 248	Across the stage still madly sweep,
2851	Girls in anticipation skip!
 231	Like down from Aeolus's lip,
 228	With one foot resting on its tip
1762	Was it not thou who thus didst stoop
 560	The sudden rattling of a car.
4205	Since in these arms I thee did bear--
2174	Forgive me! Such the love I bear
 508	All are constrained and fetters bear,
4288	From boxes or from stalls in rows.To the assembly her they bear.
4787	From everything the heart held dear
 891	_Come to my golden palace, dear_!
1641	I can't conceive a little dear
2448	His cup unto his maiden dear.
1615	Even as the love of children dear.
 860	Of roses to romancers dear;
1746	Unseen thou wast already dear.
2971	Or e'en Istomina, my dear,
4179	Not only sorrow--Ah! my dear,
4206	And since I pulled thee by the ear--
3408	As in some frenzied dream of fear
2561	Wholly beside herself with fear,
2540	Omens inspired her soul with fear,
  45	The path of hope and tender fear--
1958	Entreaties, oaths, fictitious fear,
 890	And Heavens! warbled forth we hear:
1639	They wish that ladies should, I hear,
1081	Terrible tales she loved to hear.
4835	She will not see, she will not hear.
3665	A smile from slumbering nature clear
4825	To be in conversation clear
3550	There is a spot the village near
2590	With sad refrain misfortune near.
4591	And dost thou know her?"--"We live near."
2558	A friar black approaching near,
1959	Epistles of six sheets or near,
4537	A lady draws the hostess near,
2541	Mysteriously all objects near
3409	These friends cold-bloodedly draw near
2287	My neighbour, who by chance drew near,
  43	When youth's rebellious hour drew near
4738	He daily in his drives drew near
1052	Shy, silent did the maid appear
 877	But still more stupid did appear
2445	Do me a favour and appear.
1556	Love to inspire doth woe appear
4456	Still doth the misanthrope appear?
3610	Never for me to reappear--
3572	Doth in her gentle eye appear.
1394	Would once in powdered wig appear;
4447	Unknown to all he doth appear,
 723	Go, on the Neva's bank appear,
3696	For which no springtime shall appear?
2982	But as to fighting--'twill appear!
4338	Two dressed in uniform appear--
1044	Doth in us or our names appear,
1745	Thou didst to me in dreams appear,
2656	The shining orbs of night appear;
4203	"How Tania grows! Doth it appear
4826	And happy unto you appear.
2968	More advantageously appear
4448	A vision desolate and drear
3333	In the dawn of existence drear.
2970	The aspect of a landscape drear.
3695	The coming of life's Autumn drear.
4771	But word for word his letter read.All is foreseen. My secret drear
3044	He bending whispered in her ear
4772	Will sound an insult in your ear.
2288	And breathe a drama in his ear.
 124	Modest yet daring! And a tear
3571	The simple epitaph--a tear
3330	O'er my remains to drop a tear,
4788	I then resolved my heart to tear;
 863	Had let fall many a bitter tear:
1880	Yet still her heart, which torments tear,
4051	Old women at the coachmen swear.
2046	For us, may be for many a year.
4589	Long ago?"--"'Tis the second year."
3666	Did seem to greet the youthful year;
 559	And from the Millionaya afar
2717	And grown more curious by far
2899	Unhappily too salt by far;
1423	Or the mysterious Sbogar.
2718	Just placed the entrance door ajar.
1365	The swain of Julia Wolmar,
1366	Malek Adel and De Linar,
2935	And to revive Tattiana seemed.The chairs are thrust back with a roar,
2900	And that a bottle sealed with tar
 161	And hat surnamed a "Bolivar"
1053	As in the timid forest deer,
4202	And exclamations and good cheer.
1635	Though hitherto a lady ne'er
3043	Gliding in negligent career,
3020	Amid the company career.
1265	"At Larina's."--"Hem, that is queer!
4996	To lawless love I should prefer--
1308	"Well!"--"I the elder should prefer,
2591	Girls the _kashourka_ much prefer.
1030	Romance of love I pray refer,
1861	And traces with a slender finger
1858	Tania doth by the casement linger
2673	Adroitly seized and carried her;
4739	And like a shadow haunted her.
1307	"The younger, you're in love with her!"
1585	Doth love's incautiousness in her
4264	Unfavourable unto her.
2204	He leisurely adorns for her.
1104	Not a bad fellow was her father
1105	Though superannuated rather;
4701	To Eve the universal mother,
1073	Gravely repeating to another
4704	Aye bids ye in some way or other--
1033	But finally grew bored by her.
1205	Servant of God and brigadier,
 587	On waves by tempests curdled o'er!
3506	His bit with foam besprinkled o'er,
5043	Together we have wandered o'er
 232	Now her lithe form she arches o'er
 967	So ancient warriors, battles o'er,
2630	Spanned the unbridled torrent o'er;
3551	Where dwelt the Muses' worshipper,
3211	Malicious and a slanderer.
1393	And courtier, fop, and usurer
1514	I'll sprinkle thee with holy water.--
 796	This was his social character.
4458	What is his latest character?
3652	Moscow, Russia's darling daughter,
1517	"The Lord be with thee, O my daughter!"--
2967	Thy Venus and thy Jupiter,
2962	Contend with knife and fork and platter,
2964	I'm beaten in another matter;
3658	Where better?
1630	And read our newspapers scarce ever,
1629	At Russ she was by no means clever
4355	'Fare thee well, and if for ever,
4132	Appear; along the road of Tver
1458	Hope with her fascinating power
 550	Who for the greenwood quits his tower,
4811	I tremble lest my humble prayer
1187	On Trinity Sunday yawned at prayer,
2202	Is occupied with Olga fair,
4262	Conceitedly on Tania fair,
4222	Still eats and drinks enough for twain.Their daughters kiss Tattiana fair.
 126	To cheat the inexperienced fair,
 511	Books he abandoned like the fair,
4300	To clank the spur, delight the fair--
1528	Beside our youthful heroine fair,
 306	Describe in detail the affair,
3210	Hath mixed himself in the affair,
1266	Pray is it not a tough affair
3453	The storm was hushed. The blossom fair
 675	I have dreamed many a vision fair
 487	And you, my youthful damsels fair,
2403	For Ay is like a mistress fair,
1644	Is it not true? the objects fair,
1935	Rural LifeCanto The FourthThe less we love a lady fair
1450	I uttered to my lady fair
1675	With the epistle of my fair;
4302	And Moscow many a beauty fair:
4932	Pallid and with dishevelled hair,
1526	Her tears and her dishevelled hair;
1529	A kerchief round her silver hair
  48	Cropped in the latest style his hair,
 331	With hurried hand smooths down his hair.
2184	But with confused and bashful air,
3235	Finally tost his arms in air
2821	And the Skatenines, aged pair,
3019	Approaches Olga and the pair
3797	Around the carriage of the pair--
3767	Before the altar, lo! the pair,
 171	He knows Kaverine will repair.
3264	The freshness of her heart impair,
3602	Yet still remains the old despair.
 128	Sometimes by ready-made despair;
1449	Accents of rapture or despair
  47	Lo! my Oneguine free as air,
1190	_Kvass_ needful was to them as air;
 489	Urging your droshkies swift as air
1422	The Eternal Jew or the Corsair
3768	Mark ye with what a modest air
 329	Flies past the porter to the stair,
 795	'Tis _yes! no!_ never _madam! sir!_"
4130	Petrovski Palace; come, astir!
4535	Behold, the crowd begins to stir,
2675	She cannot draw a breath or stir.
2827	And Flianoff, pensioned councillor,
1802	But gray Phillippevna the door
2728	She cannot--Eugene oped the door
2690	She peeped through a chink of the door.
3242	Olga ran skipping from the door.
2818	Fat Poustiakoff drove to the door;
3854	Anicia soon appears, the door
 233	And beats with rapid foot the floor.
 392	Upon the ball-room's glassy floor
4696	Enamoured, simple-minded, poor,
2820	Oppressor of the wretched poor;
1755	Comfort and succour to the poor,
 664	Lest the malicious reader or
4986	Is petted by the Emperor?--
 665	Some one or other editor
3855	Opens unto her visitor.
1465	And wheresoe'er thy footsteps err,
3920	The bard of Juan and the Giaour,
4972	And sermon--but in that dread hour
 547	Impressionable for an hour,
4973	I blame not your behaviour--
1772	Lo! at thy feet my tears I pour
4076	And at the stages bugs and fleas
4217	Pelagie Nikolavna has
4732	And devastate the woods around.There was no doubt! Eugene, alas!
3440	Oneguine fired--Alas! alas!
 287	In this case quite mistaken was.
4220	Still of his club he member was--
2804	With purple hand Aurora leads,
2741	With tranquil air Oneguine leads
4593	His wife approaches, with him leads
3375	To two young oaks the coachman leads.
4478	That crass stupidity misleads,
1924	Which to the neighbouring alley leads,
2938	And seek in buzzing swarms the meads.
1360	She the delicious novel reads,
 427	Crunching the morning snow she treads;
 787	If they but heard domestic loads
 788	Come rumbling up the neighbouring roads,
3618	And all that from thy hand proceeds--
4592	"Then come with me." The prince proceeds,
3826	Already dance to song proceeds;
1922	And rising from her bench proceeds;
2806	And a grand festival proceeds.
4806	And thus each stubbornly proceeds.
1362	She drinks in those seductive deeds!
4477	Professions eagerly for deeds,
3617	For riot, frolics, mighty feeds,
2936	The crowd unto the drawing-room speeds,
 426	The Okhtenka with pitcher speeds,
3824	And mourned him still. Why mourn his fate?'Twas eve. 'Twas dusk. The river speeds
3374	To bring behind: the triple steeds
4717	The languid eye of love-sick maids,
 209	Are ye replaced by other maids
2742	Tattiana to a corner, bids
1093	And gradually day unfolds.
1094	In winter, when Night longer holds
 190	Capers applauds with clap of hands,
 258	Abuse their masters, rub their hands:
  97	His son and mortgages his lands.
 993	Nor beauties of far distant lands
 992	Nor homage which the Muse demands
1338	Obedient to warm Spring's commands.
1337	Thus in the earth the seed expands
 255	The steed benumbed still pawing stands
  96	The father scarcely understands
 189	Where each young critic ready stands,
3842	With bated breath, around she bends
1776	At times my reason almost bends,
3446	The avalanche of snow first bends,
2416	Tobacco smoke the flue ascends,
3841	Tattiana from the hill descends
3447	Then glittering in the sun descends.
1775	No one my anguish comprehends,
3782	The voice of lovers, foes and friends,
1235	Of frivolous existence, friends;
4235	A maiden's secrets--of the heart.Triumphs--their own or those of friends--
2172	Against my inclination, friends,
 954	Existence without wife or friends,
3005	The feet of my dear lady friends.
4237	Their harmless conversation blends
2415	But little warmth the fireplace lends,
2096	The deuce take friends, my friends, amends
 953	His hate by slander, and who spends
1237	And care but little for its ends.
3781	On us beyond the grave attends,
3006	O feet, where'er your path extends
2171	With love which happiness extends;
4649	Sits by her gloomily, desponds,
4650	Scarce to her questions he responds,
2601	The girl on tiptoe forward bounds
2602	And her voice sweeter than the sounds
1570	Appear attuned to softer chords;
4418	And wild among them grew her words--
1569	At least their accents and their words
5052	Of passion reminiscences,
3646	Its cold unfeeling sentences;
 207	My goddesses, where are your shades?
4714	'Twas he whom, amid nightly shades,
4805	The remnant destiny concedes,
4058	"Adieu! thou home where peace abides,
2749	The unbidden guests he roughly chides--
4433	And supercilious dames she glides,
2701	In scarlet cap revolving glides.
4057	Leisurely through the gateway glides.
2699	A crab upon a spider rides,
4434	Sits down and gazes on all sides--
4417	Of migratory gipsy hordes--
4120	Moscow approach on bended knees,
3945	Whom autocratic fate's decrees
1428	May be that I by heaven's decrees
3943	To understand by slow degrees
4703	The serpent to unlawful trees
3158	Beneath acacias, cherry-trees,
 621	A due which must to earth be paid.The courtyard full of serfs he sees,
4606	Not the least trace Oneguine sees
4074	An inn at every stage erect.But now, what wretched roads one sees,
   4	And nothing more important sees;
3161	Like Horace, planted cabbages,
 280	Of thirty different sorts, lo! brushes
1875	Brambles she snaps and lilacs crushes,
1872	She fears and like an arrow rushes
 281	Both for the nails and for the tushes.
2265	And all thy precious elegies,
2080	Around the garden homeward hies.
1954	And overcome antipathies
 429	The shutters open; to the skies
1689	But lonely beneath Finnish skies
 856	Of the moon in the tranquil skies,
4622	Where all upon the surface lies,--
3358	Slumber still o'er him lingering flies.
 758	Look through the window and kill flies.
1870	From hall to yard and garden flies,
2794	Tattiana to the index flies
4136	Lamp-posts, shops, sledges, families,
2808	O'erwhelmed with guests; by families
 439	When the same life before him lies
  55	What more's required? The world replies,
1953	Ever to hear the same replies
2076	All breathless and without replies.
 425	And to the Bourse the cabman plies;
4213	Luceria Lvovna paint applies,
4214	Amy Petrovna  utters lies,
 623	Had come both friends and enemies--
2092	His friends and also enemies
1377	And the bad book accompanies.
4556	The general who accompanies.
4816	To bear love's parching agonies--
 949	Thrice happy who their agonies
4935	Her cheek reclines upon her hand.Oh! who her speechless agonies
3101	Alarmed by jealous agonies:
 454	Daily beefsteaks and Strasbourg pies
 176	Flanked by immortal Strasbourg pies,
1920	She from the winter corn espies
 334	Some a mazurka occupies,
2640	He roars, and "Ah!" Tattiana cries.
 557	'Tis silent all! Alone the cries
1378	Upon those pages she descries
1787	Even the rosy wafer dries
4135	Past palaces and nunneries,
3635	In the world's mortal revelries,
1902	And pelt him with cherries,
1904	With raspberries, cherries.
2572	To peer into the future tries.
2795	And alphabetically tries
4796	To watch with lovers' ecstasies,
5008	My splendid house and gaieties--
4490	From public and from private ties,
2969	Than cold Oneguine's oddities,
 868	At neighbouring hospitalities.
2972	And fashion's gay frivolities;
4005	I yield for splendid vanities,
5006	The gilding of life's vanities,
4491	Who glory, wealth and dignities
2091	Spared him not their asperities.
2083	The country hath its liberties
1788	Upon her tongue which fever bakes.
1786	And in her grasp the letter shakes,
 630	Of mines and meadows, woods and lakes,
2864	The doors swing open: Lenski makes
2867	The guests make room; aside each takes
 631	He now a full possession takes,
1659	Without grammatical mistakes.
2484	The third at night. Tattiana wakes
1660	May be, and this my terror wakes,
3416	The mallet loud the ramrod strikes,
4117	His recent glory he invokes.
2782	Also, to equalise the scales,
 582	Time, I invoke thee! favouring gales
2783	She got a book of nursery tales,
4133	The coach is borne o'er ruts and holes,
3031	'Tis not so now. Like gentle dames
4440	Enclosing pictures of fair dames.
4125	But lights incendiary flames
4439	And the dark fringe of men, like frames
3030	And jolting jarred the window-frames.
4663	To banish far unworthy themes
1645	To whom ye for unnumbered crimes
 348	And due precautions take betimes.
 983	Which we experienced long ago.Alas! he loved as in our times
2291	I sail upon my lake at times
4395	And the young revellers of past times
2384	And he waits dinner. Lenski comes,
3827	The fisher's fire afar illumes
3092	Whom pale Diana's ray illumes--
2290	Exhausted by my woes and rhymes,
 985	Mad spirit of the man who rhymes
4394	Beside the cup she sang her rhymes
1646	Had to compose in secret rhymes,
 347	Attentive be unto my rhymes
1790	And an enchanting shoulder shines
1097	Beneath the moon which dimly shines,
1789	Her head upon her breast declines
1541	Upon her elbow she reclines,
1096	Longer the East inert reclines
2414	Upward in a thin stream inclines.
1544	Wherein love innocently pines.
2412	The golden ember now enshrines,
4140	And fashionable magazines,
1894	Arouse yourselves, fair ones.
4891	And now he views forgotten foes,
2094	Yes! every one must have his foes,
3406	Now, like hereditary foes,
2093	Esteemed him much as the world goes.
4628	And meditative homeward goes,
 421	Straight from the ball to bed he goes,
3807	Into the tangled garden goes
2159	All vanished as an echo goes.
2494	Winter! The peasant blithely goes
 235	Between the stalls, along the toes;
 965	The accents wild of other's woes,
 191	With hisses Cleopatra scares,
4652	He fixedly upon her stares--
4653	She calm and unconcerned appears.The husband comes and interferes
2593	The wondrous host of heavenly spheres
1223	And thus ancestral dust reveres.
1231	Then seeks ancestral sepulchres,
3518	Imagination's sacred fires,
 257	And still the coachmen round the fires
4104	As with innumerable fires.
4102	White Moscow raises her old spires,
 839	Compassion now or wrath inspires
 930	Forgive the fever youth inspires,
3515	And where tempestuous love's desires,
 841	And now his youthful heart desires
 256	And of the irksome harness tires,
4142	Jackdaws on every spire--in scores.
 236	Seated, a curious look with glasses
 234	Shouts of applause! Oneguine passes
2474	In true interpretation hates:
3492	And slowly life coagulates--
3489	Which in your spirit dominates,
2471	But wretched who anticipates,
2455	Nor in his dreams anticipates
 644	Cards, balls, routs, poetry or fetes;
2721	A trouble fell upon the sprites;
2223	_Qu'ecrirer-vouz sur ces tablettes?_
1960	Rings, tears, deceptions and intrigues,
1957	And what like menaces fatigues,
1470	Her bosom heaves whilst crimson hues
 323	Which shines with iridescent hues.
2087	By poor Tattiana in the blues;
4471	For ever carps, condemns, pursues?
4018	A victim decked with golden leaves;
 268	All which caprice and affluence craves,
 267	Across the Baltic's salt sea waves,
2569	When thoughtless youth whom nothing grieves,
4017	And pallid nature trembling grieves,
2568	Twelfth Night approaches. Merry eves!
3364	Who dressing-gown and slippers gives
3372	Descends, the order Guillot gives,
1229	Thus our light race grows up and lives,
3371	He enters: to the mill he drives:
3362	He long should have been on the road.He rings in haste; in haste arrives
1232	The appointed hour arrives, arrives!
2124	Beats that of friends and relatives:
2126	Our liberty at least survives:
4012	She the acquaintances she loves,
3287	To the pianoforte he moves
4013	Her spacious fields and shady groves,
3288	And various chords upon it proves,
1238	To dreams I long have closed mine eyes,
4795	Your smiling lips, your beaming eyes,
1926	Before her straight with roguish eyes.
2731	Of frantic laughter, and all eyes
 175	And truffles, dear to youthful eyes,
2706	But wide Tattiana oped her eyes
1099	At the same hour she oped her eyes
3072	For Lenski, sought him with her eyes,
1871	Not daring to cast back her eyes.
1468	Sudden she stops, casts down her eyes
2074	Tattiana, dim with tears her eyes,
3359	But finally he oped his eyes
3302	Olga he sees before his eyes
4527	Where every day before his eyes
 266	For tallow, wood and other things
4531	His travels like all other things
2586	_The peasants there are rich as kings,
4530	But still remembrance to him clings,
1901	Disperse yourselves, darlings,
 265	All that industrial London brings
 533	All this in many cases brings
2589	Happy and glorious_. But this brings
 230	And now she skips and now she springs
 225	Brilliant, ethereal, there springs
 224	Obedient to the magic strings,
 532	With late repentance gnaws and stings.
 229	Slow circling round its fellow swings
2422	The time between the wolf and dogs--
2419	How pleasantly the evening jogs
4918	Along the Neva's bank he sleighs,
2518	Secret excursions made in sleighs;
1785	Thine honour is my countersign!Tattiana moans and now she sighs
 208	Do ye not hear my mournful sighs?
 857	Goddess of lovers' tender sighs.
4022	Hangs heavy on the oaken boughs,
 916	Exceptionless as no rule is,
4950	Calmly her eyes encounter his--
 913	Eugene, more tolerant than this
 929	And deem the world perfection is!
 791	"Oh! what a fool our neighbour is!
2099	I just hint, in parenthesis,
4815	If ye but knew how dreadful 'tis
 382	But yet Terpsichore bespeaks
4674	Lo, the ambassador who speaks
4584	Who with the Spanish envoy speaks?"--
2485	Betimes, and sees, when morning breaks,
4677	The old man who has had his freaks,
3721	Go hear the rustling of the oaks
4115	Lo! compassed by his grove of oaks,
3033	However, the mazurka lacks
3418	For the first time the hammer clicks.
2292	And terrify a swarm of ducks,
 380	As your light footprints on the green.Diana's bosom, Flora's cheeks,
4585	The prince's eye Oneguine seeks:
 526	The very morning of our days.He who hath lived and living, thinks,
1866	A horse's hoofs she hears--She shrinks!
 528	He who hath suffered ofttimes shrinks
1864	In the meantime her spirit sinks,
4970	But now--my very blood congeals,
4969	Was the meek love a maiden feels.
 180	Still thirst fresh draughts of wine compels
 289	May yet be studious of his nails;
 584	And beckon to the passing sails.
 291	Custom the despot soon prevails.
4189	The early tinkling of the bells
4190	Which of approaching labour tells
 182	When the sonorous Breguet tells
4134	Past women, sentry-boxes, rolls,
3661	Impelled by Spring's dissolving beams,
1473	Her eye with fire unwonted gleams.
3694	Do we foresee in troubled dreams
3511	He perished. Where his troubled dreams,
4370	And the heart's agitated dreams.
 648	For rural solitude and dreams,
2478	'Oh, do not dream these fearful dreams,
4279	And where Thalia softly dreams
3663	Descended swift in turbid streams
3512	And where the admirable streams
 507	This wicked, that absurd he deems,
 366	Their memory lingers still and seems
1472	Barely to draw her breath she seems,
4280	And heedless of approval seems,
4662	Awhile sound conversation seems
 506	This nonsense, that dishonest seems,
3693	Or, when anew all Nature teems,
 650	And more imagination teems.
4369	Glory with which our history teems
3648	Of conversation, thought and aims--
4124	No gift she bears, no feast proclaims,
3645	Where harsh frivolity proclaims
2381	When evening o'er the landscape looms,
3089	In Olga's and Tattiana's rooms
2702	A windmill too a jig performs
2703	And wildly waves its arms and storms;
3825	In tranquil flow. The beetle hums.
1896	The secrets of maidens.
1891	Device of rural minds acute!)Young maidens, fair maidens,
1893	Disport yourselves, maidens,
4137	Bokharians, peasants, beds of greens,
4951	Insensible her hand remains
4949	His kneeling posture he retains--
1906	To secrets of virgins,
1892	Friends and companions,
2813	Barking, young ladies' osculations,
3707	Priams of country populations
3708	And dames of fine organisations,
1440	The olden time shall be my theme.Old people's simple conversations
1442	Their offspring's innocent flirtations
2812	Latest arrivals' salutations,
4878	They were the wonderful traditions
4881	Prophecies, threats and apparitions,
3545	Had finished life amid his sons,
4680	For baseness of the spirit scorns,
2733	Tails which a bushy tuft adorns,
4682	With blunted pencil-point adorns.
2734	Whiskers and bloody tongues and horns,
3812	With flame more ardent passion burns,
3814	Her heart importunately turns.
2294	Take to their wings and fly away.But to Oneguine! _A propos!_
2622	All covered up with snow in heaps,
3036	Its stamping, capers and high leaps.
3035	In country towns, where still it keeps
2619	'Tis silent all. Tattiana sleeps.
2620	A dreadful sleep Tattiana sleeps.
2618	A little virgin mirror peeps.
3967	I will not wed, and ever weeps
 220	And dream of life's delightful dawn?The house is crammed. A thousand lamps
 222	Impatiently the gallery stamps,
4042	Feather-beds, also poultry-coops,
4045	Behold! beside their dwelling groups
2875	The two friends' compliments she hears
 918	Feeling in others much esteemed.With smiling face he Lenski hears;
4243	Without participation hears,
2574	Although the destined coffin nears,
2334	The silent fields no peasant nears,
3760	Faithless, alas! thy maid appears,
2595	Tattiana in the yard appears
4729	Mournful Love's deadly trace appears
4210	All in the good old style appears,
1867	Nearer they come--Eugene appears!
2336	With his ferocious mate appears.
3790	Distracted by her grief appears
2638	And what from its recess appears?
4246	Her sacred hoard of joy and tears,
4997	And to these letters and these tears.
1865	Her weary eyes are filled with tears--
1221	Likewise an epitaph with tears
3789	The aged mother, bathed in tears,
2876	Not, and a flood of bitter tears
3758	My poor Vladimir, bitter tears
4212	Her cap of tulle still ever wears:
4998	For visions of my childish years
4655	With Eugene pranks of former years
4283	(So 'twas with us in former years,
1075	For dolls, e'en from her earliest years,
4728	The solstice of our earthly years,
4041	Portmanteaus and preserves in jars,
  26	Have shone as one of fashion's leaders.
  23	Oneguine, O my gentle readers,
3213	Should recompense his idle jeers,
3214	But fools--their calumnies and sneers"--
2573	Old age through spectacles too peers,
4286	The jealous dame her lorgnette veers,
 920	And judgment which unsteady veers
2546	Tattiana certainly infers
4322	The hamlet, the poor villagers,
4742	If his hot hand encountered hers,
4325	Her garden, and those books of hers,
1077	She ne'er repeated unto hers.
3704	Epicurean philosophers,
4138	Boulevards, belfries, milliners,
4864	Nor almanacs nor newspapers,
4139	Huts, chemists, Cossacks, shopkeepers
3709	Spring summons you to her green bowers,
4723	Youth freshens beneath Passion's showers,
3710	'Tis the warm time of labour, flowers;
3706	Of Levshin's school ye followers,
4724	Develops and matures its powers,
 470	Nor boston nor the world's affairs
4040	Saucepans and mattresses and chairs,
 188	To the theatre he repairs
 469	He to the festival repairs,
1797	'Tis day, the family downstairs,
1230	A moment effervescing stirs,
2637	But suddenly a snowdrift stirs,
4141	Balconies, lion's heads on doors,
1356	And hated casual visitors,
1353	And the kind-hearted servitors:
2545	With one paw strokes her face and purrs,
4867	And where a madrigal occurs
4741	To swathe her shoulders in the furs,
2044	Judge then what roses would be ours,
2041	I see you weep. Those tears of yours
 475	The manners of the highest class
 297	Would loiter by the looking-glass,
1859	And breathes upon the chilly glass,
1860	Dreaming of what not, pretty lass,
 298	And from his dressing-room would pass
4734	Both day and night he now must pass
3437	And lo! five paces more they pass,
1008	Unseen in thick and tangled grass
4698	Divinity without access
1971	Yet satiated with success,
4542	There was no angling for success.
5007	In the world's vortex my success,
4938	Tattiana in the young princess!
4644	Trembling he seeks the young princess--
4697	But the indifferent princess,
 904	Thus oft--this I myself confess--
4821	Entreaties, woes and prayers, confess
3592	And now, I mournfully confess,
2019	"If the domestic hearth could bless--
2035	Me your perfections would not bless;
 361	Also their feet--yet ne'ertheless
  93	How flourish, why and wherefore less
2652	With fir-trees standing motionless
4252	Speech was so tame and colourless
 163	To loiter there in idleness
 660	The happiest days of life employ?Love, flowers, the country, idleness
4311	Her heart how full of gentleness,
1058	A child devoid of childishness
4645	Tattiana finds in loneliness.
2653	In melancholy loveliness,
 404	Her cheek of rosy loveliness
3627	And contemplative dreaminess;
3108	He _cannot_ give me happiness."
5019	"'Twas possible then, happiness--
2033	"But strange am I to happiness;
3683	Or, strange to me is happiness?
4178	Oppressive now is happiness,
1974	With laughter smothered weariness:
2457	And freezing fits of weariness.
4253	Their slander e'en was weariness;
4181	In old age life is weariness!"
3647	Amid the awful emptiness
5011	This glitter, riot, emptiness,
3593	In rhyming I show laziness.
1702	Attractive in its banefulness?
3107	I murmur not! Why mournfulness?
3615	I thank thee for thy joyfulness,
3625	Where my days in the wilderness
2927	Aroused in him some tenderness.
2117	With spiritual tenderness;
1698	Inspired by whom this tenderness,
1260	The bays of age and helplessness.
5021	My lot is fixed--with thoughtlessness
4470	Is it that human restlessness
5005	"Oneguine, all this sumptuousness,
3603	Illusions, dream, where, where your sweetness?
 132	Await the long-delayed caress.
2116	Those whom we ought to love, caress,
1259	Whose hands indulgently caress
 360	The ladies, their fantastic dress,
 131	Conquer by passion and address,
4541	Her eyes no saucy glance address,
 260	To array himself in evening dress.
 160	Meantime in matutinal dress
2669	Nor dares the skirting of her dress
 259	But Eugene long hath left the press
 403	A young Armida's lips to press,
2668	She hears the bear behind her press,
4310	Her feet the earth beneath her press!
4941	She starts, nor doth a word express,
1057	To fawn upon and love express;
4468	"Is he known to you?"--"Yes and No."Wherefore regarding him express
4822	All that the heart would fain express--
 662	I like the difference to express
2187	Dally with a dishevelled tress
3686	Inflict annoyance and distress
2926	Her agitation and distress
3616	Love's tender transports and distress,
1696	And though I read it with distress,
1138	Habit was given us in distress
2152	Nor discontinued to distress
2456	Hymen's embarrassments, distress,
2947	A strong resemblance these possess--
1694	Tattiana's letter I possess,
2021	If wife and children to possess
  94	If the raw product they possess
3282	Her nurse, who could have made a guess,
1699	This gentle daring who could guess?
2150	Alas! It is not hard to guess.
4936	Could not in that brief moment guess!
2309	The uncontaminated kiss
1598	Have felt love's agitated kiss
4952	Beneath his lips' devouring kiss.
 794	A lady's hand doth never kiss.
 926	This evanescent boyish bliss.
2307	Sound sleep, books, walking, were his bliss,
4260	Even amusing fools we miss
2097	I've had to make for having friends!But how? Quite so. Though I dismiss
2954	Can count the time without much fuss--
2631	Beside the thundering abyss
1941	Everywhere trumpeting its feats,
3024	Again the giddy waltz repeats.
1662	As every journal now entreats,
3021	Soon the maid on a chair he seats,
1358	And stay whose length none recollects.
3379	In the meantime the mill inspects.
3377	Leaning against the dam expects,
1357	Their coming which no man expects,
 320	Of slumbering citizens he fleets,
 488	Whom latterly one often meets
 490	Along Saint Petersburg's paved streets,
 643	Though without palaces and streets,
 319	Past darkened windows and long streets
1942	Not seeking love but sensual sweets.
2966	Also thy rough-and-tumble fights,
2397	And oh! what verses, what delights,
2720	The fire of the nocturnal lights;
2965	Thy heroes, sanguinary wights,
2454	With rapturous longing he awaits,
1663	Will teach grammatical conceits,
4193	As daylight glimmers, darkness flits,
3757	And his poor basten sandal knits.
3756	As formerly the shepherd sits
4192	The maiden at her casement sits
1903	With cherries, red currants,
4414	Its splendour and its blandishments,
3172	But, after mutual compliments,
3175	The epistle from the bard presents.
4416	She visited the humble tents
4640	Again the plague of boyhood--love?The hours once more Oneguine counts,
4642	But ten strikes and his sledge he mounts
3553	A rivulet beneath them shoots
3552	Two pines have joined their tangled roots,
2994	To Olga Petoushkova darts:
4201	Ever receive with kindly hearts
4085	The flimsy wares of Western marts,
4082	Meantime a Cyclops of those parts
4200	We Russians, friends from distant parts
2993	The Paris of those country parts
4437	Deliberate approach of guests
4436	Variety of speech and vests,
2975	Though for his Helen Menelaus
 909	And like Napoleons each of us
2955	The stomach doth admonish us.
 910	A million bipeds reckons thus
 201	Corneille's majestic genius,
3180	Whereto in language courteous
2244	Yea! although rendered beauteous
 184	A critic of the stage malicious,
 185	A slave of actresses capricious,
 538	To witticisms and taunts half-vicious
 870	The conversation tedious
2140	Oh! who is not calumnious?
 204	There Didelot became glorious,
4745	Or to pick up her kerchief stooped.She seemed of him oblivious,
1332	By such allusions scandalous,
2245	By Tolstoy's pencil marvellous,
1334	With satisfaction marvellous,
3639	And tiresome rogues ridiculous
5002	How mean, how pusillanimous!
3637	And glittering simpletons beside;Amid sly, pusillanimous
1298	The drive becomes monotonous--
 912	Feeling is silly, dangerous.
3716	Beyond the city-barriers haste.Thou also, reader generous,
4999	Then ye were barely generous,
3178	It was a cheery, generous
 869	He shunned those parties boisterous;
3718	Abandon cities riotous,
1299	Well! Larina appears to us
1895	Come sing we in chorus
2141	Who labours hard to humour us?
2977	Us, and like Trojan warriors slay us;
2735	Sharp rows of tushes, bony claws,
 286	The friend of liberty and laws
2732	And hoofs and crooked snouts and paws,
3568	The tightened leathern rein she draws,
3234	His watch, the sun in turn he views--
4469	Perverse, unfavourable views?
 326	And through the lofty windows views
 241	To male acquaintances he bows,
4551	The men salute with lower bows
1203	The epitaph on marble shows:
 240	With all dissatisfaction shows.
 726	Misunderstanding, words and blows.
4084	Mends with the Russian hammer's blows
 173	And Comet champagne foaming flows.
 275	Amber on pipes from Stamboul glows,
 959	When Passion's fire no longer glows
4083	Before a fire which feebly glows
2134	And this the faithful one allows,
 327	Profiles of lovely dames he knows
2515	And all the joys which Winter knows.
 352	For otherwise--God only knows!
2514	The first appearance of the snows
2496	His pony sniffing the fresh snows
 373	Upon the dreary northern snows,
4431	Through dense aristocratic rows
 237	On unknown female forms he throws.
4287	The connoisseur his glances throws
4024	O'er hillock and o'er meadow throws.
 725	Enjoy the meed which Fame bestows--
2400	And I confess that now-a-days
 905	Men become friends from idleness.But even thus not now-a-days!
 401	Of fiery youth's untutored days
3800	Alas! the friend of childish days
4109	Moscow, how oft in evil days,
 544	We called to mind our youthful days--
3609	That vanished are my youthful days,
1672	As the sins of my youthful days
2030	As partner of my mournful days,
1722	And then to meditate for days
2284	Companion of my childhood's days.
4383	O triumphs of my guileless days,
4715	Whilst Morpheus his approach delays,
1684	In one of thine enchanting lays
2282	Consisting of harmonious lays,
1673	Or Bogdanovitch's sweet lays.
4919	On the blue blocks of ice the rays
3052	Her hand for the cotillon prays.
 543	No more with pale Diana's rays,
 525	With which blind Fortune oft betrays
2165	Nor interest in aught betrays.
2398	Delicious visions, jests and fights!Alas! my stomach it betrays
2517	When he in ardent verse portrays
2163	Grows pale and sinks, but nothing says;
3380	Oneguine his excuses says;
3051	Till the mazurka's close he stays,
1160	But soon she altered all her ways,
 633	Delighted much his former ways
4072	Streams excavate subaqueous ways,
4319	And hates the world's discordant ways.
3852	Unto Anicia for the keys
3847	The household troop of little boys,
2352	A joyous troop of little boys
 437	Sleep in the shadowy couch enjoys,
 210	Who cannot conjure former joys?
3836	She gazed thereon, and instant beat
3459	Ere this but one brief moment beat
4705	Unless forbidden fruit we eat,
5000	Age immature averse to cheat--
4289	There the confusion, pressure, heat,
4379	And boiling o'er with friendly heat,
2816	Nurses who scream and babes who bleat.
3306	With lovers' rubbish filled, was neat
4333	And in a whisper did repeat:
1448	The passionate speeches I'll repeat,
1820	I mean my name not to repeat."
 303	I might to connoisseurs repeat
4865	Which lessons unto us repeat,
2107	A hundred times will not repeat,
1349	Now all things round about repeat
1601	Do not cold-bloodedly repeat
  90	And at economy was great;
 769	Alone amid possessions great,
1254	And cry: he was a poet great!
 301	Attend in male attire arrayed.On this artistical retreat
4526	Of woods and fields the calm retreat,
3907	When in the study's calm retreat,
 156	A ball here, there a children's treat,
5083	Happy who quit life's banquet seat
4525	Abandoned he his country seat,
1132	Removed her to his country seat,
1907	Approach not to gaze at
3022	Begins to talk of this and that,
1275	"No misery I see in that"--
 307	Since words like pantaloons, vest, coat,
 652	Upon my lake I love to float,
3023	But when two minutes she had sat,
2433	My friend, 'tis but to pay a debt,
4603	Her brow she did not e'en contract
3473	And blush to own himself reflect.
 666	Of keen sarcastic intellect
2058	With so much warmth and intellect?
  76	Two verses he could recollect
 217	Where I can no more recollect?--
3008	The perfidies I recollect
3009	Should make me much more circumspect,
 483	So prudent, and so circumspect
3472	The glass unwittingly inspect
2055	Such am I. This did ye expect,
4073	And Christian folk will, I expect,
 216	The disenchanted glass direct
  77	Of the AEneid, but incorrect.
 482	So full of piety, correct,
 667	Herein my portrait should detect,
 261	Faithfully shall I now depict,
 263	Wherein the child of fashion strict
 363	Three pairs of handsome female feet;
4940	Eugene fell prostrate at her feet--
1451	Long ago, prostrate at her feet.
 707	Young ladies' faces and their feet.
2354	A heavy goose on scarlet feet,
5001	But now--what brings you to my feet?--
2815	Bows and the scrape of many feet,
4291	And rapid whirl of many feet,
1876	The flowerbeds skirts, the brook doth meet,
 568	O Brenta, once more we shall meet
3240	The miserable bard to meet,
4552	And watch her eye's full glance to meet.
2106	Where fashionable circles meet
2357	But staggers, slips, and falls. We greet
 570	Your magic voices I shall greet,
4550	Her with a smile old women greet,
4145	Near Khariton's in a side street
5080	And thou, from whom Tattiana sweet;
4382	That my coy Muse might sing more sweet.
1350	Ceaselessly to the maiden sweet
3460	That heart with inspiration sweet
3241	As hope uncertain and as sweet,
 419	The words and looks of charmers sweet
1821	"To whom is it to go, my sweet?
4334	"Look quickly to your left, my sweet!"
4866	Wherein I castigation get;
3957	But time flies and she doth forget
 364	Ah! I still struggle to forget
3722	Beside a nameless rivulet,
3558	And by that shady rivulet
1981	Without enthusiasm he met
2557	When in her walks abroad she met
1133	Where God alone knows whom she met.
4959	The hour when--Fate so willed--we met
1723	Of one thing till again we met.
4851	Then in the silent cabinet
2387	Of widow Clicquot or Moet
3802	Thy dove, thy darling little pet
3884	The landscape which the moonbeams fret,
4939	Tortured by pangs of wild regret,
3507	And homeward like an arrow tore.My friends, the poet ye regret!
1982	The fair, nor parted with regret,
2556	Ere the bright messenger had set.
2441	It will be by a mob beset
1726	And we--an unattractive set--
3803	On whom a sister's heart was set
2442	Of every sort and every set!"--
3087	Whilst on the floor Monsieur Triquet
2434	For twice you came to them and yet
3955	Or parody of modern ways?Hath she found out the riddle yet?
3723	Where in the country Eugene yet,
4854	'Mid worldly pleasures chased him yet,
4958	Oneguine, hast forgotten yet
1508	"Alas! dear nurse, my heart is cleft,
1506	"Then amongst strangers I was left--
3810	Of consolation all bereft--
 779	Who secretly denounced the gift,
2498	Though deep he sinks into the drift;
 778	Unto his neighbour, man of thrift,
2499	Forth the _kibitka_ gallops swift,
2102	And by the world repeated oft,
2101	Born of a babbler in a loft
1668	Raises within my breast as oft
1666	Will to the old times faithful be.Speech careless, incorrect, but soft,
 847	But from the Muses' loftiest height
3714	In vehicles surcharged with freight;
3503	And hurried home his awful freight.
 274	Philosopher just turned eighteen.China and bronze the tables weight,
3179	Cartel, or challenge to a fight,
3275	Above the yawning grave would fight,--
4389	To many a noisy feast and fight,
2949	Eight times the heroes of the fight
3128	That, tipsy once in actual fight,
 328	And also fashionable beaux.Our hero stops and doth alight,
1029	All about Olga--to a light
2405	But wilful, frivolous, and light.
 359	The crowd and merriment and light,
 341	The voice of jealousy is drowned.In my young days of wild delight
2024	E'en for an instant find delight,
3106	"But death from him will be delight.
2319	The curse of commonplace delight.
1998	His spirit sank with strange delight.
 492	Abandoning insane delight,
2226	_Who in thy love finds more delight
4251	To find in gossip such delight,
2849	The colonel sent it. Oh! delight!
2233	In such an album with delight
1288	They will receive us with delight."
 876	A sense of social delight,
3997	And with emotional delight
 459	He finally lost all delight
 838	And bless mankind with full delight.
2178	His ardent soul with full delight.
2314	And solitude and calm delight.
1015	And solitude and calm delight,
 436	The votary of vain delight
1061	Would she in silence long remain.Contemplativeness, her delight,
 549	And like the prisoner's our delight
3595	My pen no longer finds delight,
 358	I love its furious delight,
1004	And full of innocent delight,
4367	The Muse revealed her first delight,
4105	Ah! brethren, what was my delight
2951	When tea was brought. 'Tis my delight
3321	Blest be the labours of the light,
 855	As a babe's slumber, or the light
3521	Or but for fame he saw the light;
3299	And Schiller read by candlelight.
 330	But, ere he mounts the marble flight,
 850	An ever transcendental flight;
4366	There came a sudden flash of light,
2758	Aurora's ruddy rays of light--
 491	From you too Eugene took to flight,
3067	Having remarked Vladimir's flight,
2761	And swifter than the swallow's flight.
 837	Pour on this orb a dazzling light
3454	Was withered ere the morning light--
1524	And showed with an uncertain light
3297	His care unto his pistols' plight,
1028	Her movements, voice and figure slight,
3995	Deep in the greenwood far away?Arising with the morning's light,
3274	That the two friends with morning's light
1792	But lo! already the moon's light
2390	Like Hippocrene it scatters light,
 541	The firmament in mellow light,
1498	Was younger than myself, my light,
4303	Yet clearer shines than every light
4292	The ladies' dresses airy, light,
2528	Of sunset glow with rosy light,
1852	The china teapot too ye might
2023	If in the scenes of home I might
2032	And be as happy--as I might.
1399	Time was, a valiant general might
3523	Resounding through all ages might
 827	Lay languishing both day and night--
4390	Terror of guardians of the night;
 548	And breathe the balmy breath of night;
2418	Outside descend the mists of night.
1791	From her half-open vest of night.
1016	The moon, the stars, and shining night--
4301	And vanish like a bird in air.Full many a lovely star hath night
2529	The misty evenings ere Twelfth Night.
4298	And glasses unemployed all night;
2850	So there will be a dance to-night.
 434	But turning morning into night,
 539	And gloomy epigrams malicious.How oft, when on a summer night
1807	My morning birdie, yesternight
1760	That glimmered through the radiant night
1287	"Delighted."--"When?"--"This very night.
2345	Spins, whilst the friend of wintry night,
4964	And better, if I judge aright;
3269	All this, my friends, translate aright:
2404	Seductive, animated, bright,
 853	His ditties were as pure and bright
3605	And is it true her garland bright
4293	The motley moving mass and bright,
2571	Life lies extended, vast and bright,
1850	As if he cruelly had joked!'Twas dusk! Upon the table bright
4106	When I yon semicircle bright
2417	The goblet still is bubbling bright--
1523	Behold! the moon was shining bright
1063	Adorned with many a vision bright
1759	Was it not thou, O vision bright,
 390	In winter on the fender bright,
2273	Beneath the eyes of ladies bright
2031	Thee only, pledge of all things bright,
1997	And in a vision, sinless, bright,
2492	O'erspread with Winter's carpet bright,
2176	To youthful Olga's beauty bright,
4068	And form a network left and right;
1808	I was half silly with affright.
4665	And never was the ear affright
3596	Other and colder thoughts affright,
1270	In the first place, say, am I right?
2981	Paris and Menelaus right.
2570	Before whose inexperienced sight
2980	Once more, when she appeared in sight,
4080	A bill of fare hangs full in sight
1127	The height of fashion, fitting tight,
3279	As yet none had discovered aught;
2036	I am not worthy them in aught;
 898	If they were similar in aught.
4648	Deserted Eugene. He, distraught,
3003	But by fantastic dreams distraught,
 551	As on the rapid wings of thought
1574	Because in singleness of thought
2034	'Tis foreign to my cast of thought;
 703	Of harmony enshrining thought.
4651	Full of exasperating thought.
2212	A register of fleeting thought,
4320	'Tis noisome to her there: in thought
1354	Immersed in melancholy thought,
3160	Lived as a really wise man ought,
3280	Eugene of course related nought,
4506	The seemly crowd, partaking nought
1355	She hears of conversation nought
4258	The languid mind could smile at nought,
2835	In Tania's praise in pouch he brought,
 701	And my dark soul to light was brought;
2383	A table to the fire is brought,
1576	But trusted the ideal she wrought?--
 899	At first such contradictions wrought
2834	Like a true Frenchman, couplets wrought
 375	Of splendid carpets richly wrought.
3004	My memory wandered wide and sought
4321	Again her rural life she sought,
 552	The early days of life we sought.
3159	From storms protection having sought,
4257	Though by an error and unsought--
2209	The "in memoriam" pages sought,
3431	With measured step and even gait
2482	All Nature winter seemed to await,
1191	On guests their servants used to wait
1933	Must take a walk and rest a bit--
3305	And grasps a pen: his verse, albeit
3141	Yet sometimes this or that deceit
2323	Though we will not acknowledge it.
2882	And at the table sat her down.To tragedy, the fainting fit,
2194	For maiden's hearing deemed unfit),
2207	Or, with a pen and colours fit,
1934	Some day I'll somehow finish it.
2321	On winters of the south a skit,
 157	Whither shall my rapscallion flit?
3881	The table with its lamp unlit,
2884	Oneguine could not now submit,
2195	He somewhat blushing would omit:
3880	A pleasure though with sorrow knit:
3103	Her heart: it seemed a darksome pit
 825	This he believed: a kindred spirit
2208	A dove which on a lyre doth sit;
1885	Who in the orchards gathered fruit,
1890	So mouths they stopt with song, not fruit--
4678	Renowned for his acumen, wit,
3862	The beldam saith: "The hearth, by it
4921	The snow upon the streets doth melt--
 556	E'en as the poet says he leant.
1384	A letter for her hero meant:
1899	As we lure the young gallant,
1897	Allure the young gallant
3755	Alone beside it, gray and bent,
1567	On fresh allurements they are bent,
 554	And o'er the granite coping bent,
1066	The needle nor, o'er framework bent,
3471	His butting horns in anger bent,
4711	In the unmoved, magnificent
4308	Like a full moon magnificent.
 578	Now talkative, now reticent;
4710	Who would the maiden innocent
4544	Of affectation innocent,
1579	Because she was so innocent,
3726	Near young Tattiana resident,
3117	Chief rascal, pot-house president,
 116	Haughty appear, subservient,
1580	That Heaven her character had blent
3154	With jest and gossip gaily blent.
2819	Gvozdine, a landlord excellent,
1065	Ne'er touched her fingers indolent
4688	Stiff, overstarched and insolent,
3949	Angel or fiend malevolent.
1765	Or torturer malevolent?
3120	True friend, landlord benevolent,
2817	Bringing his partner corpulent
 575	I'll pass beneath the firmament,
4307	Shines in the female firmament
4238	With scandal's trivial ornament.
 445	And pleasure's daily blandishment,
1566	A timid love to banishment?--
4777	To what malicious merriment,
4689	Awakens secret merriment
4778	It may be, I yield nutriment!
4236	Hopes, frolics, dreams and sentiment
4061	Tattiana tears cannot restrain.The limits of enlightenment
4545	Calm and without embarrassment,
 612	Having this mournful document
3752	But now--none heeds the monument
3469	With epigrams impertinent,
2005	Two minutes they in silence spent,
3857	Wherein a space Oneguine spent.
3404	Since leisure was together spent,
3725	A while ago the winter spent,
1134	She struggled hard at first thus pent,
 117	Obsequious or indifferent!
4150	A Kalmuck gray, in caftan rent
3402	The foes with downcast eyes abide.Foes! Is it long since friendship rent
1545	Now it is ready to be sent--
2007	"You have a letter to me sent.
1402	Their heroes used to represent
4121	Time-honoured Kremlin's keys present.
1764	Who art thou? Guardian angel sent
3948	Being from hell or heaven sent,
 605	To a surrender gave consent,
4830	Into thy hands my fate I yield!No answer! He another sent.
1381	She heaves a sigh and deep intent
2169	But enough! Now, 'tis my intent
 604	And with his lot in life content,
 442	But was our friend Eugene content,
1137	First reconciled and then content;
3177	And scanned in silence its content.
4098	So Tania to her heart's content
4063	In course of time (the whole extent
1400	Serve who could neither read nor write.Time was, in style magniloquent
4832	Remained unnoticed. Once he went
3856	Into the lonely house she went,
 613	Perused, Eugene in postchaise went
2168	'Tis time she to the altar went!
4122	Not so! My Moscow never went
3152	And all the three to breakfast went;
3176	Oneguine to the window went
4095	The Larinas unwisely went,
2878	The poor girl fell into a faint,
4944	His sunken eye and aspect faint,
4945	Imploring looks and mute complaint
4149	An invalid from lung complaint.
2879	But strength of mind and self-restraint
4204	Long since I held thee at the font--
2651	A forest now she sees in front
 906	In spite of common sense we're wont
4207	And I to give thee cakes was wont?"--
1411	And in the final tome we learnt,
1408	A heart wherein pure passion burnt;
 908	Ourselves as unities to count;
2650	The bear rolls on with many a grunt:
1142	And consolation soon begot.
2495	To labour in his sledge forgot,
2382	Billiards abandoned, cue forgot,
4413	Then, the far capital forgot,
1488	What once I knew is clean forgot--
2722	Oneguine lightning glances shot;
4460	Philanthropist or patriot,
3400	Zaretski and Monsieur Guillot
3390	"Behold my friend Monsieur Guillot;
3363	His Frenchman, good Monsieur Guillot,
4415	In poor Moldavia cast her lot,
 730	Grateful to Heaven for their lot.
1140	Inseparable from our lot;
 378	My country and an exile's lot;
3575	Spite of herself with Lenski's lot
1489	Alas! how wretched now my lot!"
 308	To Russ indigenous are not;
3589	Just at this moment I cannot.
4077	One moment's slumber suffer not.
2369	Keep your accounts! You'd rather not?
3659	        Where man is not.
 797	Into the district then to boot
1103	Rousseau and Richardson to boot.
4225	Examine her from head to foot.
4558	Yet viewing her from head to foot,
3573	And meditative from the spot
 728	Was a delightful little spot,
4075	Our bridges long neglected rot,
2497	Just manages a feeble trot
4859	Madame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot:
3761	Nor true unto her sorrow kept.
1197	Just before dinner-time he slept,
3345	Into the chamber where he slept
3344	Subdued him, when his neighbour stept
3759	Thee but a little space bewept,
1198	By neighbouring families bewept,
4840	A sidelong look doth Eugene dart:
1577	Because her passion wanted art,
 593	Wherein I felt love's fatal dart,
 413	Rekindled in my withered heart
4720	But the young unpolluted heart
1701	Imprudent prattle of the heart,
 698	And ease the tortures of the heart--
1380	Fruit of the yearnings of the heart.
1578	Obeyed the impulses of heart?--
 997	Unknown as yet the aching heart,
2009	Confessions which a trusting heart
2543	Presentiments oppressed her heart.
4839	The indignation of her heart!
4245	And the lone secret of her heart,
3765	A lancer captivates her heart!
3384	Method was dear unto his heart
2243	The fashionable rhymester's heart!
2874	Within her; she is sick at heart;
 594	Wherein I buried left my heart.
3387	But followed the strict rules of art,
 414	The fires of passion and its smart--
 597	But Fortune cast our lots apart
2449	Then touching Olga they depart
1700	Who this soft nonsense could impart,
2542	A hidden meaning could impart,
4234	And oft in whispers would impart
2010	May well in innocence impart.
 114	False confidence or doubt to impart,
4244	Their voices nought to her impart
 695	Poetic transport. They impart
1379	Her passion's faithful counterpart,
 125	Would at the proper time appear.How well he played the greenhorn's part
 112	How soon he learnt deception's art,
3764	By flattery and lover's art--
 127	Sometimes by pleasing flattery's art,
2241	Which from the devil's bookcase start,
2873	Anew the flames of passion start
 595	Eugene designed with me to start
4722	As vernal storms the fields athwart.
 141	His own antagonists expert,
2956	And, by the way, I here assert
2959	As oft to meat and drink advert,
 139	The heart of the inveterate flirt!
3368	To accompany him and to escort
4858	Manzoni, Herder and Chamfort,
1071	An infant maiden doth exhort
2104	And no ridiculous report,
3369	A box of terrible import.
 999	Her girlish gaiety and sport.
1070	When the obedient doll in sport
4393	Like a Bacchante in her sport
3147	At times to silence would resort,
3146	With pungent or obtuse retort,
2103	There is no fishmarket retort
4396	Vociferously paid her court,
3546	Doctors and women, sobs and groans.But, howsoe'er his lot were cast,
3205	Not bristled up like a wild beast,
2688	As if it were some funeral feast.
3207	That youthful heart--"But, now at least,
2463	He seemed for matrimony born.He was beloved: or say at least,
4177	Ah! I'm so weak--my throbbing breast!
 812	Had not yet withered his young breast.
1680	Bard of the "Feasts," and mournful breast,
4113	For every loyal Russian breast!
3898	She hid the trouble of her breast,
4247	She buries deep within her breast
4991	"I weep. And if within your breast
3271	Which rankled in Tattiana's breast,
4746	Despite the anguish of his breast,
3536	The fire extinguished in his breast,
1009	By bee and butterfly which pass.'Twas she who first within his breast
3339	And about dawn upon his breast
3225	Use subterfuge, and thus his breast
1757	To ease the anguish of my breast.
3910	Longtime her tears flowed thick and fast;
2286	I by the button-hole seize fast
3548	Poetical enthusiast,
 527	Must e'en despise his kind at last;
1345	The fatal hour had come at last--
3909	She found herself alone at last,
3535	Vanished his youthful years at last,
2901	Appeared, Don's effervescing boast,
2902	Between the blanc-mange and the roast;
2285	Or, after dinner's dull repast,
3026	Scarce credits what his eyes can see.Hark! the mazurka. In times past,
2213	A flimsy trace of musings past
 933	The laws of generations past,
 529	From shades of the relentless past.
3028	All rattled in the ball-room vast,
 931	And youthful madness, youthful fires.The gulf between them was so vast,
4465	But this is my advice, 'twere best
1636	In Russ her love made manifest,
4948	Is once again made manifest.
4256	No sense was ever manifest
3224	To treat the matter as a jest,
3607	And is it true and not a jest,
4259	Heart would not throb albeit in jest--
3777	Hath the bard, by indifference blest,
2465	The credulous indeed are blest,
2276	Just so! that modest swain is blest
3534	A life in common with the rest;
4464	Like you and me and all the rest?--
3859	Doth on the billiard table rest,
4176	Let us go seek a little rest--
2509	Ye feel but little interest,
1359	Now with what eager interest
 302	Having once fixed your interest,
3776	Or, beyond Lethe lulled to rest,
 625	The body they consigned to rest,
3875	And grant his weary bones their rest
3340	His weary head declined at rest,
2279	A beauty languidly at rest,
1479	And thus unto her nurse did say:"Nurse, 'tis so close I cannot rest.
4947	By fond illusions once possest
 626	And then made merry pope and guest,
3901	But first permission did request
1682	With this immoderate request
1405	Their idols they were wont to invest
1361	With what avidity and zest
3915	Devoured them with an eager zest.
4409	Unto the sounding sea to list,
4408	She led me through nocturnal mist
2274	Their own productions, some insist
1823	So many neighbours here exist--
2122	They may forget that we exist.
2275	No greater pleasure can exist
4096	From apprehension of the cost,
3135	That every morn at Verrey's cost
3467	Whither departed is the host?
2135	When in as instant she is lost,--
4097	By their own horses, not the post--
1100	And would by candlelight arise.Romances pleased her from the first,
 451	For treachery had done its worst;
 452	Friendship and friends he likewise curst,
3136	Three flasks of wine he might exhaust.
2841	To light had brought them from their dust,
2347	O'er all a sheet of silvery dust
2138	Who words and actions will adjust
3194	For, from the outset, 'twas unjust
2349	There! take it quickly, if ye must).
2838	Among some ancient ballads thrust,
2136	Satan will jest, and at love's cost.Oh! where bestow our love? Whom trust?
2368	And read De Pradt or Walter Scott!
4078	Inns there are none. Pretentious but
4079	Meagre, within a draughty hut,
1084	All the young people round about,
4174	See, I can hardly crawl about--
4175	But you must both be quite tired out!
1291	Can we not stealthily make out
3542	At forty suffered from the gout,
3848	Who with a scuffle and a shout
 247	Now Didelot scarce can be endured!"Snakes, satyrs, loves with many a shout
2681	Within resounded shriek and shout:
 602	Their claims and explanations shout.
3845	Yelping, a pack of dogs rush out,
 249	Whilst the tired serving-men without
1219	Lenski his pencil-case took out
  74	A little Juvenal to spout,
1083	In the broad meadow a gay rout,
 601	Of creditors a hungry rout
 203	His comedies, a noisy rout,
2682	"My chum lives here," Bruin grunts out.
 202	Sarcastic Shakhovskoi brought out
3543	Eaten, drunk, gossiped and grown stout:
2719	The wind rose instantly, blew out
4875	On lines invisible are fixt;
4314	For folly's dues thou hadst to pay.Noise, laughter, bowing, hurrying mixt,
4874	His eyes, the printed lines betwixt,
4316	A pillar by, two aunts betwixt,
4857	Perusing Gibbon and Rousseau,
3293	To the young girl he said adieu,
1809	But praised be God! in health art thou!
1627	Demands that I translate for you
4967	But with austerity!--for you
3976	"But, _matushka_, to Moscow you
4887	And now upon the snow in thaw
4853	The time when Melancholy's claw
4230	Obedient then to Nature's law,
2641	He offers her his murderous paw;
1546	For whom, Tattiana, is it meant?I have known beauties cold and raw
4888	A young man motionless he saw,
2707	When in that company she saw
4233	Her tresses curled in fashion saw,
4852	He in imagination saw
 824	And marvels deemed he thus should view.
3668	The woods, still naked to the view,
 753	Because he yawned at the bare view

2067	Thus trees in spring their leaves renew
 914	(Though certainly mankind he knew
  98	But upon all that Eugene knew

1611	The triumph of a conquest new.

3292	Heavy his heart with anguish grew;
1751	I flushed up, stupefied I grew,
4358	As in a garden when I grew,
4883	Or letters of a maiden young.And by degrees upon him grew
4885	And soon imagination threw
3424	Aside the foes their mantles threw,
3655	Who can help loving mother Moscow?
3651	Moscow
4504	To look on life as on a show,
 736	Villages in the distance show
 118	What languor would his silence show,
4171	To-morrow Tania we will show,
1283	Would you to me this Phyllis show,
3989	Unto a carping world must show--
1056	Nearest and dearest knew not how
4930	He back as from a sudden blow?--
1092	Morning's forerunners, breezes blow
2510	They are all natural and low,
1704	A feeble version read below,
2486	Park, garden, palings, yard below
4933	Gazing upon a note below.
1363	All the creations which below
1234	Us from the world wherein we live.Meantime, drink deeply of the flow
2907	Seductive cup of love, whose flow
2399	With its exhilarating flow,
1364	From happy inspiration flow,
3579	Or did her tears soon cease to flow?
 497	Nought from his pen did ever flow,
 982	Where plentifully feelings flow
4647	They sat, but conversation's flow
 119	How full of fire his speech would glow!
3770	Behold her downcast eyes which glow,
 737	And herds of oxen wandering low;
4103	Whose countless golden crosses glow
2942	Maids in the corner whisper low;
3289	Then, eyeing Olga, whispers low:
3888	With folded arms and eyes bent low,
3449	To the youth Eugene hurried now--
4467	Society he duped enow."
3988	The unaffected traits she now
1522	"I am in love, nurse! leave me now."
1452	Then they came easily enow,
1236	Its insignificance I know
3392	No obstacle of which I know.
4588	You choose."--"But who is she?"--"My wife.""So thou art wed! I did not know.
1989	And in the morning doth not know
4582	"Inform me, prince, pray dost thou know
4162	"Tania, my eldest child, you know"--
3284	Now gloomy seemed and cheerful now,
3580	And where may be her sister now?
2665	Grown clammy, stick fast in the snow;
 322	Cast a gay lustre on the snow,
2666	Her handkerchief she loses now;
2358	The first bright wreathing storm of snow
2487	And roofs near morn blanched o'er with snow;
2483	Till January fell no snow--
 315	But such is not my project now,
3753	Of woe: effaced the pathway now:
3286	Is ever thus. With frowning brow
3448	The cold sweat bursting from his brow,
3889	Cocked hat and melancholy brow.
3583	The misanthrope of gloomy brow,
 321	Till carriage lamps, a double row,
3122	How perfect doth our epoch grow!
1091	The horizon luminous doth grow,
4503	Nought but of dinners a long row,
2429	How charming Olga's shoulders grow!
2147	And all your love on self bestow;
3365	And linen on him doth bestow.
4161	'Tis a scene of romance, I vow!"
3720	The Muse capricious let us coax,
3671	Flew to collect his rural tax;
3670	The bee forth from his cell of wax
3032	We glide along a floor of wax.
2123	And so--God bless them, if He list.In this the love of the fair sex
2125	In love, although its tempests vex,
4432	Of diplomats and warlike beaux
2401	I prefer sensible Bordeaux.
3531	And past the threshold of decay,
   7	Chained to his bedside night and day
2370	Then get mad drunk or wroth; the day
 154	What, invitations? The same day
 394	Beside the stormy sea one day
2777	Unto their solitude one day,
 608	And what the old man might bequeath.And in reality one day
4641	Impatient waits the close of day,
1088	To anticipate the break of day,
3229	To-morrow before break of day,
2164	Listless is she the livelong day
2376	He sat, and then the livelong day,
3811	Well nigh her heart in twain was cleft.In cruel solitude each day
3643	In haunts of fashion where each day
1980	Jilted--glad of a holiday.
3872	Spectacles upon nose, all day
2847	He enters. Ah! good news to-day!
4087	The ruts of his own fatherland.Yet on a frosty winter day
 441	To-morrow just like yesterday.
3267	Nor shall the bud of yesterday
  83	From Romulus unto our day.
2119	We visit about Christmas Day,
2756	She gazed around her--it was day.
 105	And wholly occupied his day--
1841	Olga's admirer came that day:
3188	Had much to do at home that day,
 628	As men who much had done that day.
3185	That he was "ready any day."
3243	She was as heedless and as gay--
3137	Time was, his raillery was gay,
2490	Down in the courtyard magpies gay,
 969	In yarns of youthful troopers gay,
 440	Till morn--life uniform but gay,
4342	And for a time our course delay,
 136	Arrange without the least delay--
1131	The bridegroom sage without delay
 152	One morn whilst yet in bed he lay,
4089	No senseless fashionable lay
 610	How sick to death his uncle lay
3356	With pallid light, but Eugene lay
  82	Within his memory there lay,
1213	"How often in thine arms I lay;
1130	Then, her distraction to allay,
3088	In jersey and in nightcap lay.
1214	How with thy medal I would play,
2848	The military band will play.
2198	A game of chess would often play,
3873	Was wont with me at cards to play.
3059	Cunning already to display
4296	'Tis there that arrant fops display
2389	For the young poet they display.
2757	Lo! through the frozen windows play
3139	To make wise men the idiot play
3385	He would not that a man ye slay
3309	Like D when dinner doth inspire.Destiny hath preserved his lay.
4616	In the beginning of this lay,
3040	Unto the hero of this lay
2906	Fair object of my guileless lay,
1478	Restless Tattiana sleepless lay
2232	Have smuggled his flagitious lay.
4313	Enough, enough, conclude thy lay--
2293	Who, heard the music of my lay,
5081	Was drawn, ideal of my lay--
3324	But the dark sepulchre I may
2231	Some army poet therein may
4198	That grandmothers and grandsires may
 477	And though perchance a lady may
2120	Or by a card our homage pay,
4014	Another visit hastes to pay.
4340	"Who? Is it that stout general, pray?"--Let us congratulations pay
3233	To see his Olga ere the fray--
3184	Curtly announcing for the fray
2627	With boiling torrent dark and gray;
3322	And blest the shadows of the night."To-morrow's dawn will glimmer gray,
2385	Driving abreast three horses gray.
2295	Friends, I must your indulgence pray.
1805	"'Tis time, my child, arise, I pray!
 133	Avowal then 'twas time to pray,
 396	Which rushed in eager dense array
 764	Here bottles stand in close array,
4873	His intellect in close array.
2903	Behind, of glasses an array,
4399	But I abandoned their array,
2489	The trees in silvery array,
1804	A cup of tea upon a tray.
3060	And well-instructed to betray!
3644	All with urbanity betray,
 705	Nor doth my absent pen portray
2297	Minutely I will now portray.
2779	Tattiana purchased with a stray
4896	She sits alone--'tis ever _she!_So frequently his mind would stray
4299	Thither hussars on leave will stray
4614	Transfixed Oneguine mine doth stay.Is this the same Tattiana, say,
 478	Discourse of Bentham or of Say,
3998	Surveying them, she thus doth say:
1535	And starting suddenly doth say:
4898	Almost became a poet say--
1842	"Tell me, why doth your comrade stay?"
2367	Alone beneath your rooftree stay
3187	He cared no longer there to stay,
3994	Horror! had she not better stay
3291	But it grew late; he must not stay;
3355	A passing snowstorm wreathed away
1914	Nor did her blushes fade away,
1090	The starry beacons fade away,
3528	Carried a truth divine away;
3042	Oneguine Olga bore away.
4401	How oft the kindly Muse away
4643	And gallops to her house away.
3294	As it were, tore himself away.
5082	Ah! what hath fate not torn away!
3226	From the dread pistol turn away.
   8	Without a chance to slip away.
1592	The mystic lines to tear away
3813	And to Oneguine far away
4871	But thoughts meander far away--
1533	But borne in spirit far away
2162	Across the smiling face of dawn.Alas! Tattiana fades away,
4015	But Summer swiftly fades away
 704	I write, and anguish flies away,
1098	And calmly sleeps the hours away,
 104	It whiled his idle hours away
3266	The lily's stem to eat away,
4613	Unto her husband, went away--
 627	With serious air then went away
3231	On thigh or temple, friend on friend.Resolved the flirt to cast away,
 765	There jars of cider block the way,
 168	His furs are powdered on the way
3386	In a lax or informal way,
1978	He still made love in a queer way;
3996	Unto the fields she makes her way,
4339	Ah! he has gone the other way"--
3311	"Oh! whither have ye winged your way,
1095	A hemisphere beneath her sway,
2626	Impetuously clove its way
4215	Ivan Petrovitch still a gaby,
4216	Simeon Petrovitch just as shabby;
 700	But I, in love, was mute and dull.The Muse appeared, when love passed by
2710	Oneguine sat the table by
1827	But I was sharp in times gone by.
3567	Stops at the tomb in passing by;
 372	No trace ye left in passing by
4569	At table she was sitting by
3013	The whirlwind of the waltz sweeps by,
 562	A boat with splashing oar floats by,
4094	And like a palisade flit by.
1387	Alas! my friends, the years flit by
1714	At first, I clung to secrecy:
1049	Nor by her sister's brilliancy
1632	Possessed nor ease nor fluency,
3775	Hearing the fatal perfidy?
4317	Tania, observed by nobody,
2197	And  they
4196	A stable, kitchen, fence appeared.To consanguineous dinners they
1915	More crimson every moment they.
2374	To idle musing was a prey;
1593	A lover's letter might convey,
3634	Eventually petrify
5059	May find a crumb to satisfy.
3532	He ne'er shall hear Time's eulogy,
 573	Possess my love and sympathy.
2930	The witching light of sympathy;
1568	At least by show of sympathy;
1992	Eugene was touched with sympathy;
 750	I cannot tell the reason why,
3053	She fears she cannot.--Cannot? Why?--
2324	Already Autumn chilled the sky,
1089	When on the pallid eastern sky
 574	The nights of golden Italy
2249	Presents her quarto amiably,
 751	But Eugene, incontestably,
1435	Nor shall my pen paint terribly
3357	Upon his couch insensibly;
3851	Tattiana asks, and hurriedly
4809	At morn I must assuredly
 563	And now we hear delightedly
3677	What agitation languidly
3586	A true account and in detail.But not at present, though sincerely
1168	Entrusted all to her sincerely,
3900	And turned to leave immediately,
4336	"No matter, look immediately.
3439	Took aim--but as immediately
4019	Dark clouds before the north wind fly;
3318	Or innocently past me fly.
4003	Delicious nature, thee I fly,
2725	Tattiana would attempt to fly,
1916	Thus shines the wretched butterfly,
 337	The feet of graceful ladies fly,
1389	The evanescent fashions fly
4054	Unto the gates the servants fly
 354	I long have ceased to offend the laws.Alas! life's hours which swiftly fly
4562	And ruthless fashion hath blackballed.I like this word exceedingly
4371	And the world met her smilingly,
3436	Though he advanced unceasingly.
1225	Harvests of souls unceasingly
4568	Enchanting, but unwittingly,
2444	"Who will be there?"--"The family.
4172	What say you? to the family--
 468	And like Childe Harold gloomily
4116	Petrovski Palace! Gloomily
2054	Mute, solemn, frowning gloomily.
2491	And the far mountains daintily
2724	All arise. To the door he goes.Terror assails her. Hastily
3445	So from the mountain lazily
4784	I would not part with finally;
3874	God save his soul eternally
 145	With him were friends eternally:
3278	But of this love, e'en casually,
3966	To all she answers cruelly--
4363	By waters shining tranquilly,
  53	Danced the mazurka gracefully,
4462	Or other mask donned playfully?
4108	Descried before me suddenly!
5088	Have my Oneguine--suddenly.
1919	Thus shakes the hare when suddenly
 851	His transports were quite maidenly,
4166	"What! Grandison?"--"Yes, certainly!"
3556	The reaping girls approach and ply
2880	Prevailed at last. She in reply
1166	Her caps and night-dresses to mend.As for her spouse he loved her dearly,
3588	Though I'll return to him right early,
 193	That all may hear his voice's tone.Thou fairy-land! Where formerly
2933	From habit or maliciously,
 299	Like Venus when, capriciously,
1594	Or into bold hands anxiously
2372	You'll spend your winter famously!
  52	In the French language perfectly,
2836	Known unto children perfectly:
1816	"Then send your grandson quietly
3281	Tattiana suffered secretly;
3153	Then he'd malign them secretly
2609	To lay two covers secretly.
2916	Turned to her and discordantly
2751	Grasped a long knife and instantly
4634	Oh! I accept. And instantly
4197	Conduct Tattiana constantly,
1348	The same warm vision constantly;
 351	Employ your glasses constantly,
2726	She cannot--then impatiently
4446	With clouded brow stands silently?
2662	Around her neck, now violently
4170	His son is married, just conceive!""And he--but of him presently--
1042	And of the attic. Honestly,
  31	Three balls a year he gave ye duly,
  29	Having performed his service truly,
4813	The artifice of villany--
 805	He brought from mystic Germany
2846	The captain of a company.
4445	But who in that choice company
4337	There, in that knot of company,
3650	Wallow, my friends, in company!
3169	The man and liked his company,
3619	I thank thee. In thy company,
1455	Thou hast resigned thy destiny
1770	Then be it so! My destiny
1961	Aunts, mothers and their scrutiny,
2100	There is no stupid calumny
1087	Their giddy sports she ne'er enjoyed.She loved upon the balcony
4402	Hath whiled the road's monotony,
 102	It occupied him from a boy,
4365	Into the study of the boy
  39	Instructed jestingly the boy,
3203	Not a mere hot, pugnacious boy,
3719	Which in the winter were a joy:
 103	A labour, torment, yet a joy,
 659	In idleness and tranquil joy
4368	Sang childhood's pastimes and its joy,
3222	Now for the jealous youth what joy!
2564	Wherefore? She found a secret joy
2566	Thus Nature doth our souls alloy,
3717	The chaise long ordered please employ,
  38	Fearing his pupil to annoy,
 129	The feeble moment would espy
 338	And following them ye might espy
 944	Attentive listened to the lad.But more the passions occupy
4131	Drive on! the city barriers hoary
4661	Light sallies without coxcombry,
2727	She strains her throat to force a cry--
2753	Dark shadows thicken--a dread cry
3346	And wakened him with the loud cry:
2603	Of clarinet or flute doth cry:
4814	I hear your harsh, reproachful cry.
3633	Grow harsh and cruel, dead and dry,
3792	But my Tattiana's eyes were dry.
5018	Beneath a cross and shrubbery.
2488	Upon the windows tracery,
2607	By night prepared for sorcery,
3343	But scarce had sleep's soft witchery
3360	And turned aside the drapery;
2580	The clue unto some mystery
 822	To be a charming mystery:
3262	With ardent sighs and flattery
1563	Alike by sighs and flattery.
3155	_Sed alia tempora_. And bravery
3111	There dwells five versts from Krasnogory,
4129	Adieu, thou witness of our glory,
4185	But, her own room in memory,
4118	Here, drunk with his late victory,
1482	Relate some ancient history."
3109	Haste, haste thy lagging pace, my story!
 702	Free, I renewed the idolatry
4573	That Nina's marble symmetry,
 941	Fragments of northern poetry,
4664	And platitudes and pedantry,
3223	He feared the criminal might try
2371	Will pass; the same to-morrow try--
 371	Lapped in your Eastern luxury,
1424	Byron's capricious phantasy
 940	Carried away by ecstasy,
2919	Must bow in common courtesy;
2053	Is full of frigid jealousy,
 113	Hope to conceal and jealousy,
4183	And fits of coughing racked her chest.By the sick lady's gaiety
4428	Lead into good society,
1623	Lest jaded with satiety,
4430	With jealous fear, anxiety.
1862	Upon its damp opacity,
4800	This, this were true felicity!
3250	Before such fond simplicity
3251	And mental elasticity.
1438	Of Russian domesticity;
4823	Yet with a feigned frigidity
4848	Cursing his own stupidity,
2193	(Nonsense and pure absurdity,
 718	Discovered much absurdity,
1549	By dull insensibility,
1571	And then with blind credulity
1962	And husbands' tedious amity?
2963	But grant with magnanimity
2362	And naked uniformity.
 514	Like him renouncing vanity,
4690	By his embarrassed dignity--
2844	Of old maids the divinity,
2961	Whom thirty centuries adore.I will with thy divinity
3773	Passed into dull eternity,
3524	Have echoed to eternity.
1693	Hears not my importunity!
3015	As giddy youth's hilarity--
2011	Charming is your sincerity,
1547	As Winter in their purity,
4880	Dreams with no continuity,
 744	The style of wise antiquity.
1041	It carries of antiquity
4879	Of kindly, dim antiquity,
1620	With hope and then perplexity,
4564	With us 'tis quite a novelty
4783	Also my wretched liberty
 655	The child of sloth and liberty.
 195	Von Wisine, friend of liberty,
 808	Idolatry of liberty,
4790	I thought--retirement, liberty,
4006	Thou too farewell, my liberty!
 130	Of tender years the modesty
